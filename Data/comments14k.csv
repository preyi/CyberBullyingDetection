These people are freaks!,1
Ben Shapiro is correct.,0
I wish I was Ben for that moment. The coroner would have been pulling that dudes nuts out of É??herÉ?_x009d_ mouth.,1
"If you're the smartest one in the room, you're in the wrong room.",0
"He'd never say that to someone that is a physical threat, cowardly.",1
Everyone in the room flunked biology except Ben.,0
Why would he go home in an ambulance?,0
He is disgusting with a disgusting ideology. ????,1
"looks like a man, sounds like a man, physically violent",1
So ambulance is going to take him home??! That thing is crazy!,0
It's her you're not being polite to the pronouns ????,0
I only see Ben Shapiro standing for truth without fear while many people around there are fearful to stand for truth and choses to side on the foolishness.,0
"I don't care what side you're on in this debate, what Zoe Tur did is not justified in any way
Also funnily enough, Caitlyn herself mostly agrees with Ben on this lol",0
"that dude crossdresser she is a man, male, gentleman",1
Is that Quagmires dad?,0
Was that threat from the man inside inside or what?,0
"Ben wimped out. He can say whatever he wants on podcasts now. But he was like a deer in the headlights here.

The leader of the high school debate team sees what its like on the street in the real world.",0
So that man can threaten ben shapiro and no charges or arrrest.  Lock up the loser.  He is a man and needs to grow up.  You dont treaten ppl with your arm around there neck....,1
"So fucked up that after someone puts their hands on someone else and threatens with physical violence, the hosts focus on the supposed rudeness of the person being threatened instead of condemning the threat.

This is identity politics gone too far. Trans person=victim no matter what. You disagree with something, you are a transphobe.",1
very hard to keep your male side hidden when annoyed lol,1
"This is crazy how this has gone this far, man is man woman is woman, thats it, ben kept calm, while the OTHER MAN threaten him, smh",0
Mr Zoey Turd is a fraud,1
Ben is a legend . Thank God for him,0
Still got that dog in you lol. Cant hide that.,1
Lmao you'll go home in a ambulance.,1
He got his cock chopped cause Diddy said he had too...,1
"""You knew what you said would incite violence""  so it's ok to be violent if someone hurts your feelings?",0
IÉ??m sorry we are gonna need a replay on that. Being transgender is the bravest thing you can do?! Who dropped this man on his head?,0
Bruce stole a legitimate Award for women. Lunacy. Sick.,1
"It's so funny that Ben said ""facts don't care about your feelings"" since Ben's arguing from emotion here, and the facts are completely against him on this.
 Ben should've said ""My feelings don't care about the facts.""",0
"Como cuando te sale el verdadero YO en ti: y haces un comentario totalmente de hombre/macho, y eso puedes verlo en la naturaleza, los hombres/machos al sentirnos que estamos 
perdiendo el control frente a otro macho, tratamos de recuperarlo a base de la fuerza bruta, y bueno aqui el chiste se cuenta solo: aqui shapiro le hubiera contestado: ya ves? al final 
se te salio el machito del que tanto estas tratando de desaparecer",0
"If America discusses this issue, then she is on the path to real decline. Smh.",0
"The most difficult thing you can do is being an actual mother with a dead child.   He needs to live in the real world! This MAN makes me sick!  Genetics are pushing a
 living person out of your own body!  I would like to this alleged woman who is actually a man perform this act!",0
Should be titled man dressed as a woman threatens man who had the balls to say that????,1
IÉ??ll call those freaks whatever I see them as,1
"Seriously though, I wish allt he worst for Zoey Tur. Truly set backt he transgender movement years by doing this. You don't get to respond to words with fists.
 If that's okay, then transgender people are going to be beaten down, left and right.",1
"If any man thinks he can be a woman he can forget about it!  I will pronounce the word HE, there's no way any man can ever experience what a woman experiences, 
from the first period, childbirth to menopause, if a biological man thinks he can be a woman FORGET ABOUT IT!!!! And I'm insulted at the idea of it. Grow your hair long, w
ear some pretty dresses, you are not a woman!!!",0
Because it is a damn delusion. Damn the USA really is becoming stupider as years go by. Sigh .....,1
me I'd kicked his ass........,1
It's absurd that they all flock to Tur's defense,0
This man with a blonde wig,0
"That's the problem with this people, they always get so emotional bcs they didn't solve their inner conflict yet and it's impossible to talk to them. I already had talks with trans people who did solve their conflict and the talk was very different. Understanding and informative.
Genderdysphoria is no joke, very complex to understand due to biology and psychology going hand in hand... sadly it's not going to be understood by the crowd very soon.",0
IT'S MA'AM!,0
"What a joke, these people are a joke! Ben is a legend!",1
I am transphobic. I find them to be unnatural beings. No IÉ??m not a trump supporter.,1
I would took care of business right then,0
"Mr. Shapiro I am sorry to see threatened during an intectial discussion you argument is correct there is no way to turn a man into a woman. A disguise or hormones
 don't change the persons sex. I wish these people would be told the truth about that fact.",0
2:04 male hormones incoming,1
BEN is RIGHT ! so RIGHT!!!!!,0
I remember when this was new,0
I have never seen a woman threatening a man in this manner.  Jennifer just proved she is actually a DUDE????????,1
"0:25 when i grew up to bravest thing you can do is to protect your own family and country....suck people nowadays that pushing these sick gay agendas on people and our
kids in school....ban this sick shit ! media shoukld not give them any platform ! except for them that wlays pushing this out cause they got paid like on zionist movement and so on",1
"Americans are so foolish...????
So, a full grown man wakes up in the morning, wearing a lady's gown and now prefers to be called a woman...???? 
In addition to that he can now use women's bathroom, play women's sports, and be throne into women's prison ???????ú???ú
And everyone in the room agrees with him except just one person who everyone want kicked out so it can be all FOOLISH people.
And the woman/man threatens people ???ú????",1
"Shapiro is a little dude, the dude in the dress woulda got his ass kicked had I been on the stage.",1
BEN is a repressed homosexual....why he talk sooooo fast is a mental mystery????????????w2????,1
These liberals are all mental cases. 30 years ago this É??manÉ?_x009d_ would have been put in a mental hospital and heavily injected.,1
Sicko,1
THEY DON'T LIKE FACTS OR TRUTH.....THEY ARE DELUSIONAL,1
I bet Ben feels like banging his head against a wall,1
this is getting ridiculous,0
"I am 64 years old and I remember when I was a kid and when someone imagined they were something else than what they really are like an animal or they thought they 
were someone else other than themselves they were put in a mental institution. And now itÉ??s like they all escaped from the mental institutions, I guess there are no more
 mental institutions doing business anymore.",1
"The truth and potential solution to the gender debate:

The gender debate is pretty pointless because itÉ??s really just about vocabulary. ""Gender"", first used in the 1400s, originally referred to grammatical categories, like in languages where nouns are male, female, or neuter (e.g., in Russian, tables are male, cars are female, windows are neuter). It wasnÉ??t until the 1950s that ""gender"" started being used for humans, but it was never meant to describe biological sex. It referred to roles, behaviors, and identities, separate from biology. This isn't a new concept though, as even some ancient cultures had more than 2 genders, each with their own gender roles. Over time, people started confusing gender and sex, thinking theyÉ??re the same thing, but theyÉ??re not.

The confusion comes from namespace collision: using terms like ""male"" and ""female"" for both, which causes people to argue that a trans woman is ""really"" a man. But thatÉ??s missing the pointÉ??gender is how a person feels, looks, and identifies, while sex is biological. So, saying a trans woman isnÉ??t ""real"" because of her biological sex mixes up the definitions of sex and gender. Both terms have existed separately from the start. Whether or not being transgender is a mental illness is irrelevant.

I propose that the namespaces are separated so that gender pronouns are separated from sex pronouns. Since the biological namespace used the words ""male"" and ""female"" first, it should get to keep the terms, and the gender namespace needs its own words. One way to do it is suffices.

Potential suffices to use: -ish, -like, -esque, -oid, -leaning, -aligned, -presenting

Examples: maleish, female-like, male-esque, femaleoid, male-leaning, female-aligned, male-presenting. Or perhaps even a brand new suffix purpose-built for gender.",0
Man this guy is a one man army right here,0
"red blood cells have no chromosomes also like people who have XX chromosomes and get pregnant with someone with XY, the pregnant person can have cells with Y chromosomes going
 unexpressed. Ben Shapiro doesnÉ??t understand genetics or biological sex. he has a poli sci and a law degree. neither of those are biology",0
Ben Shapiro is nut,1
Shapiro is when you speak in real life the same you do in the comments ????,0
"Lmao all yÉ??all worried abt him if he wanna be slick he can be dealt with swiftly and slickly and he can stutter and act all flustered but he started the bs u can disagree and still remain

This is what it looks like when you go against a delusional herd.,1
Going out as a transgender is the bravest thing you can do? Come one! Being brave and being shame less is different!,0
Oh my! What male energy you are exhibiting SIR,0
Protect trans rights,0
"Typical woke uneducated delusional behaviour yet again, and surprise surprise threatens violence when faced with the truth",1
What Ben said is not insulting itÉ??s facts,0
See how a male she testerone comes out in an argument. What woman tells a man he will go home with an ambulance? Absurd! I would never do that! Im not that strong to challenge a male.,1
Ben Shapiro É??Big fanÉ?_x009d_????,0
"Shapiro aura +1,000,000,000,000",0
beni boi gets excited,0
"É??When the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the loser.É?_x009d_

He actually threatened Ben Shapiro on camera and not one person had the courage to call him out on it. Disgusting.",0
"É??Being transgender is about the bravest thing you can do!É?_x009d_ 

Try and tell that to our soldiers; past, present and future. They themselves, and all of us who are eternally grateful for their sacrifice, vehemently disagree with that atrocious statement.",0
I love me some Ben Shapiro lmao,0
I remember when we all hadnÉ??t lost our minds before the pandemic ????,0
So spitting out the truth is delusional? Yeah right,0
"That was malely inappropriate,  I would say",0
"A trans YouTuber tried making this look good when Ben Shapiro was being threatened. Honestly, while Ben was being disrespectful, but he didnÉ??t deserve to be threatened like that.",0
"Being a soldier is pretty brave, giving birth without epidural, thatÉ??s brave. When a child stands up for another child, thatÉ??s being bullied thatÉ??s brave putting on a dress and 
make up is not brave itÉ??s Hyper sexualizing something they should do in their fucking bedroom",1
"""Im not on that train, she want to be called she ill call her she"" abiding to what they want to hear to be in their favor. Coward.",1
The testosterone never leaves you. ????????,1
if somebody telling the truth.. that rude to them. stupid trans,1
I like Ben. But I would have enjoyed seeing this play out because I guarantee you Ben would have been humiliated ????,1
"ItÉ??s incredible that nobody there called out the dude in the dress for putting his hands on, and threatening another guest! Shapiro should have sued!",0
The internet made people too comfortable talking shit and not getting punched in the face for it,1
Look at that man face the man hands the end is near,0
That is a male it's like we're living in the Twilight zone where do these people come from ????,0

"Hitler was the biggest hate monger in history, people like Shapiro want to bring back that doctrine of hate, and I don't like it, we are not all the same, except that and move on,",0
"Says a grown man who should be husbanding, fathering and grandfathering brave and strong but instead he is wearing a dress! LOL",1
Ben Shapiro vs 5 women and 1 man. This was crazy.,1
That GUY threatening Ben Shapiro is very rude ???≠ HE should be ashamed of HIMSELF ???≠,0

Bruce is a man! The POS sitting next to Ben is a man also!,1
How sad is this world if we have to admit that Shapiro is the only one with a brain in that room? Opinion based pronouns are what matters now? This is crazy and insane.,1
OH SO BECAUSE THEY SEE HIM AS RUDE ITS OK FOR BEN TO BE THREATENED WITH PHYSICAL VIOLENCE??  IF A MAN HAD THREATENED A WOMEN LIKE THAT THERE WOULD BE UPROAR,0
"What woman says ""carry on and you will be going home in a body bag "" to a man, and is twice the anotomical build to said man. These people ????????",1
Bruce is a man! This man pretending a woman is a man.,1
But to be fair but to be fair but to be fair but to be fair but to be fair. But to be fair you don't get the right to threaten someone because you got your feelings hurt.,0
Absolutely disgusting,1
He's one man army n he's destroying this stupid illusion people,1

on that panel call yourself a Christian you know that God said it's an Abomination you know that God only made man and woman you know this so why are you going against God",0
Threatening violence like thatÉ?? so ladylike!!,0
Bring him to Saudi Arabia,0
"I always hate how they bring up people born with a genetic disease who, in most cases, go through with surgeries and medicine so they can feel like a normal person, for these
 trans people to coopt that rare condition and use it as an argument for thier dilusions.",0
"Him being on womens of the year time award was prabably a huge dissapointment for any women that achieved something great that year. I just feel really bad for all the athletes that,
 in certain sports such as boxing, they basically have no chance against these freaks. They are breaking records left amd right and weenies who have never picked up a ball in thier life 
are the ones making that call",1
"""Chromosomes don't necessarily mean you're male or female"" What the hell do you mean?????????????",0
"It's always disgusting to witness failed pretensions to put superior intellects against the corner. Perhaps, this trans-clown and his acolytes have already taken a ride in 
ambulances due to self-induced threats of neurological nature. Ben Shapiro shouldn't waste his time with people spending time in redefining what else butts are good for.",1
He made that threat and get away with it?,0
Dr Drew dropped the ball on this one. If you would talk to him today (2024) he would be brave enough to admit he was wrong.,0

"This guy in a dress open threatens him with violence, and those other dip-wads say to be fair É??you misgendered himÉ?_x009d_

No. Violence is never ever appropriate in a scenario like this.",1
"A room full of delusional adults ... lol the only guy who is honest is a Jew .. what the heck is going on here.  They all stood up for a trans who just openly posted a threat to another

An ambulance would take him to hospital not his home.,1
ZoeÉ??s a disgusting excuse of a human being.,1
When Ben Shapiro became top G,1
for the love of TRUTH!!!!,0
That disgusting filthy man lady needs to be in prison,1
men in dresses is just ridiculous,1
Nonsense! You're either a man or a woman! This guy doesn't like hearing truth! ????,0
"His anger toward Shapiro clearly reveals heÉ??s a straight up man pretending to be a woman. IÉ??m sorry but as a lesbian that is a tomboy I simply learned to love my beautiful female body 
and accepted my sex and realized IÉ??m better off being who and what I am than being someone else because I changed something about myself which will ultimately make me lose myself 
and regret it and become extremely depressed .. self love baby!!",0
Still showing how much a man he actually is Mr Jenner you have a prostate enough said,1
Hahhahaha bruce got mad ???ú,0
Freak!,1
"A biological man is a male.
I like the boldness in that guy.

Threatening violence and putting your hands on their neck is masculine,1
"What a male thing to do, to threatened someone that they will go home in an ambulance, Ben wouldn't stand a chance, no stopping those male hormones ????",1
That man put her huge ass bigfoot hand on Ben. Someone get a tranquilizer dart gun from the zoo,1
"Actually, ambulances never really take you home, only to emergency.",0
That linebacker jawline really helps define the overall feminine look.,1
Sooooooo.......tough. Turned hisself into a chicky.,1
how freaks act when they dont get their way,1
Brave? ???????????? lol u ppl are freaking dillusional,1
"If that he/she gets that upset over a discussion about being a freak, he has mental issues!

If you're a man and you insist on dressing like a woman and ppl make fun of you because they don't buy into your bullshit, you have the problem not the debator!",1
So calling a biological man as a man is É??insultingÉ?_x009d_? Lord have mercy on these idiots!!! Shapiro good for you for not joining their delusion.,1
"If bruce still has a dick  bruce is still male, bruce used his MALENESS to threaten another person, and then wants to plead I'm a woman  i felt threatened. What a bunch of shit.",1
"I'm not one these people who are on stage supporting this trans lies  to make themselfs look good I agree man is man just like women is women there XX  Xy .

If you have a dick you ainÉ??t a chick.,1
"Who cares, he is a guy not a woman. These idiots need to be put in their place.",1
Zoey was showing her maleness with that physical threatÉ??,1
"Zoey is the uneducated one, saying the ambulance would take Ben home. No it doesnÉ??t, it goes to the hospital.",1
I'm amazed Shapiro tolerated that weirdo touching him on the shoulder and the back of his neck. I would've told the perv to get his disgusting ball-ticklers off me immediately!,1
"To me, thatÉ??s sad when you got grown men that wonÉ??t stand up when they see a man trying to act like a woman. And the facts are his DNA is made as a man.",1
So you need to have courage to be a freak?,0
ThereÉ??s a D missing in that bloke ZoeyÉ??s surname.,0
And there you have it right there. The trans guy canÉ??t take it so threatens with extreme violenceÉ??,0
"That man threatened Ben  "" YOU WILL GO HOME IN AN AMBULANCE"" ? did I hear that correct? 
Mr Zoey, the bravest thing in the world, you know what that is, accepting what you are, and you are a man, you look like one, because you are one. You cannot demand that we go against what our eyes see.",0
This is mockery,1
what are your genetics -ben shapiro,1

"erm, actually, I identify as a Doctor.",0

individuals. Ben was right the whole time. These people are delusional",1
What a pig,1
"Well now, that's not very ""ladylike""!",0
"if ben did that to ""her"" the panel would have stood up, walked off and not returned until he left...but the thing did it...and all they said was ""well you deserved it"" hah",0
Polite to the pronouns is wild,0
Caitlyn jenner is not a hero,1
Where can we find the full interview,0
Zoey proved he was a male when he threatened to send Ben home in an ambulance. Only men say that shit.,0
"Why did they even invite Ben knowing his beliefs and then get upset when he expresses his beliefs lol isn't this supposed to be a safe space? No. 
Because ""Safe space"" is code for ""pro LGBTQ space""",0
"I don't like Ben because I find him too radical and aggressive  in his thinking, he doesn't come across as someone who wants to help these delusional people like Matt Walsh does,
 Ben sounds like he enjoys torturing and humiliating them because he thinks he's always right, most of the times he is right, but he is so full of himself and arrogant and  
no offense but his voice is so annoying.",1
He threatened to attack Ben Shapiro and when he called him out on it the guy on the other side said basicly "yea but you were rude" as if that makes threats of violance are jusitfied xD,1
Bottom line? You are a man! I hate the woke culture! It's all a lie!,1
"""Being brave is being yourself.""

Being brave is when you tell the freaking truth and stop lying ????",0
I agree with Ben here,0
Zoey a violent person before the hormones and surgery as well as after,1

A  man...in a dress,1
very lady like at the end,1
The guy with mental health issues threatened Shapiro infront of everybody and no one did anything about it.. wow,0
That dude was outta line to Ben,1
all that makeup couldn't conceal his toxic masculinity,1
Looks like Woody Harrelson in Anger Management.,0
2:08 ShapiroÉ??s mind: Why should I go home with an ambulance ?,0
So the testosterone laden É??womanÉ?_x009d_ displays all the attributes of a male possessing toxic masculinity to prove heÉ??s a female.  Got itÉ??É??.and IÉ??m the one who is crazy and a hater.,1
Ridiculous. You can threaten someone like that and get away with it?,1
"The jew was right , this pedo should be call he !",1
"If they dug up Kaitlyn/bruce Jenners bones in 300 years and dna tested them, if there was any dna left to actually test, the dna test would say they are the bones of an adult human male.

Now, the archeologists who dig them up might think the undertaker was playing a joke on the family by burying a man in a grave marked with a womans name, but im not from the future, so idk.

That's just what i would think, given the fact there is a man in a womans grave.",1
Love how they placed Ben next to him and he proceeded not to gaf lol,0
Mental illness is running rampant in society.,0
Shapiro wins brutality fataly that trans is a man because he act like one jajajajjajjajjaja. If he is a she im the most rich in the world,1

"Prabhupé_x0081_da: The bodily structure, it can be changed. Perhaps you know, now in medical science they can change the woman's body into man's body, and the man's body into woman's body. It was formerly being also changed. In Bhé_x0081_gavata you'll find that in a gardenÉ??I forget the nameÉ??in a garden where Lord è?iva was engaged with Umé_x0081_, husband and wife, all of a sudden many saintly persons entered to see Lord è?iva. At that time Umé_x0081_, Pé_x0081_rvatéÆ, became very much ashamed. She was not very properly dressed. So immediately the saintly persons, they left, that ""Lord è?iva is now in his private affairs."" So Lord è?iva, to please Pé_x0081_rvatéÆ, he immediately said, ""Hence forward, anyone who will enter this forest, he'll become woman."" So one king, I forget the name, with his party, without the knowledge he entered the forest, and all of them became women.
So the idea is that the man's body can be transformed into woman's body, and a woman's body can be transformed into man's body. Because we are not this body, dress. Suppose I have got this dress. This man's dress I can transform into woman's dress with a sari; but that does not mean I am woman. So every one of us living entities, we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. The outward dress, man and woman, that is dress. Vé_x0081_sé_x0081_†?_x0081_si jéÆr†??é_x0081_ni yathé_x0081_ vihé_x0081_ya [Bg. 2.22]. We are changing this dress.",0

And they still say they are a man, just feeling more comfortable being called she. They love themselves and spread love, i respect them as women cause they are what i feel is womanhood, love, motherhood behaviour, NO violent tendencies and a sweet timid reaction with a cute smile when they talk about stuff they love.

That is obviously just my own opinion. I just really ain't a fan of all the people who have to shove it in your face that they are gay or transgender and just make that vision their personality... Women are sweet and cute, there isn't anything cute about telling someone to shut it or get beaten up ... ^^""",1
I was hoping the drag queen would have kicked his ass,1
You donÉ??t go home in an ambulance ????????,0
He*,0

"if they only knew how Ben Shapiro felt about criticism of Israel, they could have shown his hypocrisy",0
Extreme lack of brain cells within that panel. Wow.,1
The thought of her picking Ben up and just body slamming him for triggering her is absolutely hysterical. Wouldve made the show ten times better ????????????,0
Funny how when "she" gets mad the violent threats come out... its almost like the lipstick doesnt change anything at all and there is still a man with violent tendencies in that dress ????.,1
"Ben is 100% right about this , its a He !!!",0
Bruce said he regrets trying to be a woman.,0
This is weird...,0
Why people like to lie??  That a fcking dude use dress and pretend to be she.... ????????????,1
You're agreeing with me because you're not educated.,0
"As a physician and a scientist (M.D,PhD), I would like to make clear that 1) we do not employ the word É??genderÉ?_x009d_ in the natural sciences as this is a social concept. 2) Although you may have learned that XX is a woman and XY is a male, that is because biology like math is foundational, so many concepts are simplified in the primary and secondary educational settings. In the scientific community we have robust debates on terminology and arrive a consensus based on the current body of knowledge. The XX and XY concept of biological development is considered incorrect in scientific literature. In science, we first distinguish between people who are or are not capable of developing  primary (before puberty) and secondary (after puberty) sexual characteristics. This is because there are four genotypes that can give rise to a female with primary sexual characteristics (XX, XO, XXX, and XY (rare cases). Only two genotypes, however, give rise to both primary and secondary characteristics and fertility (XX, XXX). It is interesting to note that all fetuses will develop primary female characteristics unless the presence of one gene on the Y chromosome is present and functional. The scientific community first defined a female as anyone without a functional SRY gene, and male as any viable fetus with a functioning SRY. Whose genotypes may be (XY or XXY, OY is not viable). 
The point is that this is a complicated issue treated much differently in the natural sciences, so please refrain from invoking biology or science in anything related to the trans debate. These are purely social issues not scientific ones.",0
Let's ignore the chromes for a minute....huh?,0
"The world is ending. Dingly dangly bits = male, moneybox = female ???? discussion over",1
The pathetic little Ben got just what he deserved he is uneducated he is ignorant he is a bigoted racist and he's going to screw around and find out little Ben is pathetic excuse for a man,1
"Wow, when you know you've lost the argument because your speaking poppycock and you resort to violence.",1
They must have deleted the word "sir" from the video. It's not audible.,0
Hey Mr. Pretend a transgender man. Let me ask you this. If a male canine feels the urge to be female canine should their pawrents mutilate their doggie bits?,1
Shapiro is right. They are still men. We shouldn't have to play into their delusion.,0
Ben shapipoo hates trans people he just wants them all to die. Literally a fascist. How can a jee be a fascist ????,1

ZOEY YOUR A MAN!!,0
"He reacts like a man, lol.",1
Facts are insulting now.  This world is so twisted.,0
Why was nobody telling Zoey to remove her hand from Ben's shoulder? Simply putting your hand on another person's shoulder is a sign of dominance. And it's usually a male thing.,0
"I would welcome the challenge, as it was a direct treat",0
"This is not threat, its more like a flirt in their community. Ben has been in the closet. They both probably went home together after this.",1
Ben should have retaliated,1
Typical Leftist can't win a debate so they call names or threaten violence!!!!,0

Trans is so gaslighting this is what they want lol,1
"That creature literally made treat to Ben about sending him to hospital, and nobody did go against it. They were like OK OK, let's be more polite please. Bunch of bigots",1
Man now all these years later and what happend to Candace Owens for her prophesying her love of Jesus and Israel killing Palestinian people non stop I wish this person did kick little ratty Shapiros ass,1
The moment he put his hands on my neck like that and threatened me would of been the day he turned into a woman.,1
That is the definition of a bully.,1
I cant believe how insane ppl are these days. Im 40. NEVER .....EVEEEERRRR thought this would be a convo,1
On behalf of all Men if Shapiro was to end up in hospital we will declare this day a National Holiday ......,0
Bro was malding.,1
Did he manhandle Shapiro? Where is that guy now?,0
"ItÉ??s a fucking debate. Jesus christ.

Oh Lord!...Please forgive the G@yLords! ????,1
Zoey reminds me of Quagmire's dad on Family Guy.,1
That whole room full of people except for Ben are so afraid of what people might think of them depending on what they said is sickening,1

Caitlyns come back. "Stop that or you  will go home in  an ambulance" What a tough guy,0
A violence hand squezing  the neck and direct  threats of beating him... should have sued this guy.,0
One of the kindest things you can do for Caitlyn is tell him the truth; he is not going to heal any other way!,1
Ben should have said '' This threat sounds way too manly for a ''woman '' :))),1
That ''lady '' looks like a WWE character lmao,1
"I always found it funny how everyone stepped in when ben used apparently incorrect pro nouns, but no one said anything when he was threatened with physical violence.",0
reminds me of robin williams in mrs doubtfire lmao,0
Where can i find the full debate cause that was hilarious,1
The black dude is a straight biÉ??h. A grown man putting on a dress thinking heÉ??s a woman. How lost is this society,1
It's a Men why y'all try so hard,0
"If they do not like it they try to mute it.
Ben was right and they could not prove him wrong so they try to mute him by falsely causing him of bein rude and or offensive when it did not work they try intimidation.
They where not there to have a conversation and discussion with Ben.",0
"I love how, ""she"", immediately resorted back to a physical threat of violence... You know.. a male trait..",1
Caitlan threatens like a tetesterone driven angry  male.  No woman would threaten like this!,1
"Funny she, he, responded just like a man.  ????  What if there was no speech, written, or spoken, no pronouns, none of this stuff Would be relevant.  Wait does not matter all still irrelevant.",1
"el hombre es hombre, produce esperma
la mujer es mujer, produce ovulo
no hay mas genero",1
Everybody here except Ben ended up looking like total douche bags,1
Ben Shapiro's only solid moment.,0
Damn. 8 years ago and Shapiro is still an uneducated dumbass.,1

horribly difficult? or horribly ignorant dumb and inexplicably stupid?,1
Go home in an ambulance? Some dirty transvestite threatens somebody on national television and the chicken littles do nothing? Not even admonished? What a sick world we live in.,1
"An ambulance takes you to the hospital, not your home. Maybe his stupidity is why he doesn't understand he's a man.",1
Common sense is the 1% in today's times,0
this former navy seal finally realized a quack phycologist convinced him he was trans... now he is back to being a man.,1
That is exactly what the lefties do....violence no discussion,1
All the years that trope that transgenders are passive and mostly  non violent. Time to rethink all that.,0
Too much and too little to unpack here,0
Ben was the only one there with right state of mind.,0

Shame on everyone going along with this delusion,0

She just told Ben he didn't know what he was talking about which was rude.  He responded in kind.,0
"Damn, is this your ""Great America"" ?",1
This guy just proved he should be called sir. Hilarious.,1
Read Dueteronomy 22:5. Its called in The Holy Bible Detestable and is Sin.  Repent or Perish in The Lake of Fire Forever,0
"I'm on both sides and against both sides of this. Shapiro talks too fast, like a chipmunk on speed. Don't trust anyone who talks that fast. Aside from him not having the balls to Stand up to a buffoon like Trump. So I like seeing him get threatened.

The whole gender identity thing is fishy to me. I think a lot about the whole drag queen story hour, where a drag queen goes into a kindergarten to read fairy tales to children. Firstly, How can they tell ""Jack and Jill, when up the hill?"" Was jack a girl? Was Jill a man? Then you take the drag queen out of it, and imagine a grown man wants to spend his spare time, going to kindergartens. I would say that dude's a pedophile. I would take my kid out of that school.",0
"""Facts don't care about your feelings"" ... Who would have thought that eight years later, this would have been a #1 rap hit ?",0

I noticed Ben didn't do it again.,0
Disgusting ........ specimen of humanity.,1
She threaten him. Lay her hands on him and nothing. If their  roles was reverse he would be in jail.,0

"No 1 is born ---. It is how they brought up or or their childhood life.
* Candace Owens says incidents make gays, so can be cured or should not be encouraged/accept gays.
* Even the straight boy - doesn't know he is straight at age 0 or 1 or 2, etc... Through his life journey with incidents: he likes to have a girl friend, so he becomes a straight.
* Same a gay boy - doesn't know he is gay at age 0 or 1 or 2, etc... Through his life journey with incidents: he likes to have a boy friend, so he becomes a gay.
* OR if the incidents from both parts above, then a bi.
* Incidents example: straight (he gets attracted to a girl, not getting molested by a male, or even if gotten molested he didn't liked it and didn't want to pursue it), gay (he gets attracted to a girl, he gets molested by a male, and he likes it, then/before he gets attracted to a male, or very simply - at starting itself getting attracted to a male w/o any molestation - the so called current 'born gay')
* So incidents happen to even straight people.
* So chances are there that no incidents happened to gay people - born gay. as simply falling attracted to a boy (w/o any molestation or daddy issues) is also an incident, we can say 'i knew i am gay', instead of saying born gay.
* it is all at the end, what you wanna be, and America gives freedom to be who you wanna be (see: being gay is not a choice; freedom here reflects: coming out of closet & expressing oneself), so I am proudly expressing me, through my community LGBTQ+ and through rainbow flags at my home and streets. still there are people who can't come out of closet and live inside them peacefully.
* Ben Shapiro mainly identifies gays as polygamous and can't bear children and can't sustain in long relationships.
* There are straight people as well, who are polygamous and can't impregnate and get divorces so can't sustain long relationships.
* I brought up in a society where 1 life partner for entire life is the way of life. For me even monogamous is atrocious, but what to do if got divorced/widowed, instead of living single, it is good to have second partner. 
* Not all gays are like fuck each other around, like the straight fuckboys out there.
There are gay people who are monogamous, adopt/surrogate children, sustain long relationships - as well.
* I am a gay boy. Whether I am into this through incidents or just like that - is none of your business.",0

"    Erik, for crying out loud. You legally can have sex with children, but not with underage children. Underage children are children beneath the legal age of consent (different states have 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 as the underage limit. Children in most countries means someone under the age of 18. In Ireland for example, a 'child' aged 17 is over the age of consent. In Britain it is 16. Do you know the first thing about the topic?   The name is standard english asage. Scandal is a POV term. Allegation allows the discussion of cases that have not yet come to court, which cannot for technical reasons be prosecuted and cases that were thrown up as invalid. Roman Catholic Church sex abuses allegations in standard english means allegations about the Roman Catholic Church.   Public relations is minor tabloid point when you are discussing the rape of children, so stop adding in an irrelevant topic.   Your mucking around lost a lot of changes, spelling corrections and other problems solved. I was caught in an edit conflict with you and given the scale of the changes could do nothing but a cut and paste job. I then tried to go in to your version to transfer over accurate changes but then you started this insane fucking around with the article's location, using a POV title.

The fact that you are using your familiarity with the English language to get a cheap ``winning point`` out of a lost game, tells us how weak and pathetic you are.

Palmer, I justified it by writing that ``Google returns 13500 hits for the query ``Tom G. Palmer`` cato [3].`` ``Tom G. Palmer`` alone returns 34,900 hits on Google [4]. So on this point, my vote is not necessarily inconsistent (34,900 > 19,000). :Well, sure, but that's weak``35000 is notable, but 19000 isn't``. Come on. That's not serious.  ::But even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don't know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote. :Understandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, ``son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right.`` So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.    `",1

I happen to be a member of some mailinglists (yahoogroups actually) on which Julius has written an enormous amount of very good articles on MP3 and stuff relating to audio-engineering, in Dutch. Many of the info he, his cousin and/or some others have put on this particular site, I see no reason for them to be needing any more visitors to this webpage than it already has; there are no popups, not even google-ads on it, so really, get your act together: This has NOTHING to do with spam. In fact, when I looked into this IP-address you blocked, I found that it resolves to ``jult.net``, not to jthz.com, and even though it might be used by Julius, who is also one of the creators of the page you regard as spam, I still don't see the connection to ``spam``. Being able to use your admin-tools does not mean you need to abuse people on Wikipedia.

It's not spam and it has never been spam (and you know it isn't, your beef is something else, I don't even know what it is). Links YOU left in there ARE spam though, but you seem to be blind to those, so I will remove them for you. 3.

Even a cursory Google would show that Jonathan Sarfatti and Jack Sarfatti are not the same person and live on different continents. Notice how silent the Great Mathematician Dr. Hillman is in the light of Nobel Prize physicist Brian Josephson's remark above putting him in his proper place and in Hillman's inability to respond to Sarfatti's detailed argument above. It is not enough to bluster ``it's nonsense``. Burinski will also respond he is not on e-mail all the time. None of your facts check out.

"`   == MY STATEMENT ==  AND WHAT IS IT I DID EXACTLY TO BE BANNED? WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN? You are obviously not aware of what is goinf ??g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes. I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it. But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish. An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang. Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ??factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair. It was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this. Bishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her proteg?? had been blocked. i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight. You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit. She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it. She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi. She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much. She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff. The arbitration should have been about this too. They are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds. And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it. He even insulted Nicholas turnbull. Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves. Wiki english is a spot on the face of Wikip??dia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.  This has to stop. I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate. He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request. This don't go and has to be aborted. I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.  None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration. It is a close debate and not an arena game. THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning. He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted. He must be removed as well. i dont accept what happened tonight. There was absolutly no reasons for me to be blocked and certainly not for 3 days. If I say fuck! like ybm nothing happen, but if I bring precious evidencies, so I am ban and the evidencies confiscated and destroy yes, and detroyed as they have been alredy here several times. This is the sign of a totalitarian system, and wiki english has became a totalitarian system, where the judged perform the judgement, and were all proofs are stollen and destroyed and were disturbing people are threaten for their meaning and impert to say more, and blocked away.  To say what you did, you can only be one of those people who repeat non stop what the one before them just sayed, but will not dream of looking at the matter himself, just as bishonene did fr",1

I made analogies between admin behavior and classical abuse of power. *I was personally attacked. No admins have been blocked.  *I was not trolling.  Calling me a troll is nothing but a lie designed to anger me and cause me to overreact.  It's an attempt to fabricate ``evidence`` for a block. *At least one admin thinks my being called a troll is enough evidence, because now I am blocked.

Block Nandesuka for repeating the error and then attacking me for defending the oppressed individual.

You have been lying all along including today, and right here above! , please see the following examples of lies from just today, and here I'll quote what I wrote to him earlier:    :: Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you ``liars``; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:  :: QUOTED: ``I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.     :: QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as ``1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression.`` First of all, ``all editors have reached a consensus on the article`` is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others ``have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system``, Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with ``- For a start,`` Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in ``the clearest possible words`` when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss ``differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)``, and then again , who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about. The dictionary defines a liar as ``One that tells lies`` and ``a person who has lied or who lies repeatedly``, if you want me to stop calling pointing out your lies stop lying!  ()``  : In addition, I did *not* start the POV fork (Alternative views on Arabic numerals).   : In addition, you are being misleading and also lying about the following ``I replied to his comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and at 22:08, asked him on Talk:Arabic numerals to respond to my comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8.

"You are talking nonsense again. The reconstructed pronunciation is not a modern theory nor has it been substantiated by modern linguists. Repeating the same old 19th century out of date fallacies in a modern book does not constitute evidence or substantiation. The only differnece between modern linguists repitition of these fallacies and the original is that the modern linguists have removed all of the racist slurs from the original work (well most of them anyway) and have included the disclaimer that none of the nonsense they are regurgitating is provable given the historical evidence, or rather the complete lack of it, and modern research which is unanimously against the theory. Thanos Papadimitrakopulos publication is a perfectly valid source since it postdates the standard form of the reconstructed pronunciation that is still taught today (a theory that is never substantiated to students but is taught as unproven dogma) and he has never been refuted. Chrys C. Caragounis is a linguistics expert and a philologist and is thus a valid source. Development of Greek and the New Testament, Mohr Siebeck (ISBN 3161482905) is his most recent publication a probable the most recent research on ancient Greek pronunciation in existence. Anyone claiming to be an expert in ancient Greek that still believes in the reconstructed pronunciation has no right to be called an expert since it is like believing in the Ptolemaic Earth centred universe which observations have shown to be wrong. All of the experts in Semitic linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek at the time the Septuagint was translated from the original Hebrew in 280 BC. This therefore implies that classical Greek must have been pronounced like modern Greek as well otherwise 72 Hebrew expert who were taught ancient Greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the proto-Semitic fricative gimel in Gomorra which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the Greek letter gamma. Gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that Semitic linguists use to show that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek and that the Hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives. It is clear from the study of Semitic linguistics and from experts in the filed like Caragounis and Papadimitrakopulos that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on Germanic supremacy (as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators) and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone.

"`  RDH, I wouldnt be so proud to label youself a ``Wiki Facsist``, as you have no idea of what the original meaning is of that world. That particular philiosophy caused millions of people to DIE, and people who disagreed with them were put to death. Please read the Wiki entry on Facsists.   And, how do you know that the orignal entry on a page (with no corrobarting backup) is ``factual information``. You adjust your meaning of ``factual information`` to fit your particular brand of socialist bullshit. Just because Leithp is less of a ``Wiki Facsist`` is not a glowing statement either. The Wikipedia concept is doomed to failure becuase we have so-called editors like yourself who edit the pages to satisfy yourselves. A real editor has knowldege of a particular subject matter, and is supervised by people to ensure fairness of content. The REQUIRED registration solves no problem except less work for people like you, but still leaves an enormous creditability problem, which WIKI has been recently exposed to have. SO, have fun while you can, since this format is bullshit as far as a serious encyclopedia venue.  Go help Sting save the rainforests moron..`",1

(you need to be a subscriber to access it, but it is certainly not hard to find). If you tally up the total UDA/UVF/LVF killed in the book lost lives (from 1968-1998) it shows 90 Loyalists killed by the IRA and INLA during that time period. The book ``The Irish War`` also gives the number of 90, on the page I quoted, as does the Jane's intelligence report. That is THREE sources to the one source you quote. I am sick of having my hard work hacked up by some half-assed administrator who can't deal with the fact that his IRA article was full of innacuracies. I have contacted a friend of mine who is a senior administrator, you should be recieving an E-mail from him shortly. Unless you want your administrator privilages revoked, I suggest you either stop re-editing my article, or merge my facts with your own. I am pissed that I took the time to re-submit the article in the way you asked, and you are still throwing a hissy fit. You are one of the worst administrator's I have ever dealt with, you are the reason academics don't respect Wikipedia.   PS.

By calling everyone under the age of 18 a ``child``, which the dictionary correctly defines as a human between the ages of infancy and puberty, you can make everything even remotely sexual sound salacious and evil.  Teenagers are insulted to be called ``children,`` and if you start using terms like ``teenage sex`` and ``teenage sex with adults`` to describe problematical behavior by kids old enough to know better, the ``poor little abused children`` angle is more difficult to sell.  Maybe we should just go to the ultimate extreme, and legally define everyone under 18 as a ``baby.``  Then all sex with minors could be ``poor little babies being abused and raped,`` which would no doubt please the Judith Reisman's, John Ashcroft's, and David Finkelhor's of the world.

At Mr. Berry's request, Jimbo has deleted the entire Justin Berry article, along with its complete revision history, and its primary author has been indefinitely banned from editing Wikipedia for, get this, ``pedophile trolling,`` which is apparently Wikipedia's description of dissent over its censorship.  Jimbo has also gutted the talk page, calling any criticism of Mr. Berry a ``personal attack,`` and demanded the article be completely rewritten from scratch, presumedly by persons who can only parrot the mainstream media's spin on the tale.  Jimbo has also claimed that pictures of Mr. Berry appearing in the article are ``copyright violations``, even though Wikipedia is filled with ``fair use`` pictures whose copyright is owned by others, including screenshots of copyrighted television programs.  Mr. Berry is a news story.  I greatly doubt there are any copyright issues with using a picture of him archived forever on a plethora of search engines, and available to anyone, to illustrate the article.

"  TVTimes images Hi Ben! You've recently uploaded and added to articles some images of covers of TVTimes magazine. You've correctly tagged them as fair-use/magazine, but I don't think the images are being used under fair-use considerations.  The tag for fair-use/magazines says:  ...It is believed that the use of low-resolution images of magazine covers: to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question,...  The images are being used to illustrate programmes, not the TVTimes magazine. Therefore I'd say they're not being fairly used under the terms of Wikipedia's fair-use copyrights policy.  Additionally, the tag says ...To the uploader: please add a detailed fair use rationale for each use, as described on Wikipedia:Image description page, as well as the source of the work and copyright information. These images do not have a fair use rationale on the image page and they don't provide the source of the work (scan, taken from another website etc).  I suspect that the images will need to be removed from the articles you've put them in, but I'd be interested in hearing your views. Thanks É?? ÉùùREDVERSÉù?   Your quibbles of fair use are so much ridiculous pedantry, and if this is the level of petty officiousness you subscribe to here, I'd sooner not bother. Fuck you, cunt.  ",1

If you could give some reason for your actions then perhaps all of us site owners who were deleted could understand, but we do not see that there is any justification for what you have done, nor has anyone offered any. The ONLY message we're getting here is that it pays to manipulate Wikipedia for personal gain and delete everyone else's links but your own. WE HUMBLY REQUEST YOU RECTIFY THIS MATTER AND THEN LOCK THE PAGE TO STOP THE PERSON WHO STARTED ALL THIS FROM DOING IT AGAIN - which happens to be the one link you have left on the page.

"`  : While I respect the fact that you've obviously given this some thought, a few counterpoints: 1) Every single state in the union, with the possible exception of Rhode Island (mostly because it's so damn tiny), is a ``transitional`` state with the features you mentioned. Examples: California includes ghettos, really rich gated comunities, hick towns (such as Watsonville, or virtually any city more than 100 miles from the coast), and the Bay Area. New York? Same deal, if you've ever been to upstate New York you'll see. And of course, the reverse is true too - a lot of Texas is really nice, progressive even. I've heard some less-than-terrible things about Birmingham, Alabama. Even Okla-dumbass-homa has some okay parts of Tulsa. So I honestly believe that you're about 180 degrees on this one - your statement, while eloquent, was somewhat meaningless, whereas History makes some valid points (the most valid of which is that if you (speaking in the generic, non-threatening second person) call me a ``southerner``, I will tie you to the back of a pickup truck and drag you to your death while throwing beer cans out the window to hit you in your skull.  `",1

As I recall, your involvement with Wikipedia Review was because you were guilty of hate speech, in that you suggested that ``people with autism should not be allowed to edit Wikipedia``.  Malber, you are a poor person to comment on such an issue.  You should have been banned from Wikipedia for your comments, yet here you remain, continuing with your hate speech.  You are quite correct that Amorrow engaged in hate speech, although of a lesser variety of the kind used by you.  He was banned, as you were.  You, Malber, were banned for hate speech.  Did you forget this?  Perhaps you forgot this.  The place that is the only place devoted to criticism of Wikipedia is indeed important.  You can disagree with as much of it as you like.  Criticism, by its very nature, is not generally accepted by those who it is critical of.  This does not illegitimise it.  There are many and varied very legitimate criticism.  One such criticism is why a hate-monger such as yourself is not banned from Wikipedia.  Perhaps you are biased in this however.  Perhaps you'd like to argue how you are less of a hate speaker than anyone who has ever posted on Wikipedia Review.  As far as our evidence has proven, you are much worse than the worst on WR.

Is this right? - Juuitchan  Someone suggested: ``Heath Robinson`` and ``Rube Goldberg`` as a vocabulary difference.  It's certainly an interesting parallel, but I don't think it really belongs here.  They were both artists with their own style, and both are known on both sides of the pond although their use as descriptive adjectives is split as suggested.  At any rate, they can't quite be considered translations, because as an adjective, ``Rube Goldberg`` is more specific, describing an overly complex mechanical device or a complex series of interdependent actions; Heath Robinson, in contrast, is more surrealistic or fantasy-oriented.  LDC  As an American, I would like to say that to me a bum is a homeless person as much as the butt, a flat is an apartment, and rubbish certainly is trash.

I may do some actual research, and come back and fiddle with that list. - Eean.  :I think Americans certainly understand the use of ``bum`` for ``butt``, ``rubbish`` for ``trash``, and (to a lesser degree) ``flat`` for ``apartment``.  But we don't use those terms much.  Point to a container for discarded things, and an American will say ``that's a trash can``; a Brit will say ``that's a rubbish bin``.  Americans are more likely to use ``rubbish`` in the sense of ``bullshit``.

"`:In an interpreted language your source code is read in command by command by a software tool, which is called the Interpreter and executed.  What ? Command-by-command ? No interpreter is using such crappy technique nowadays. Taw  === From Interpreted Language/Talk ===   :some languages (like Perl) are compiled at runtime  Could you elaborate ? Taw  Every time a perl script is run, Perl compiles it and then runs the compiled code. At least, this is the usual way of using perl, although it's not the only way. Zundark, 2001 Dec 15  You mean compile to syntactic tree or compile to machine code ? Taw  : I believe it's compiled to bytecode, much like Java. As of perl 5.6 (version?), it's possible to produce a bytecode version of a perl program to save the compilation step. I think the bytecode can be converted back to full source as well, but I'm not as sure about that. Indigo Perl (http://www.indigoperl.com) produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable, but I think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode, so they tend to be rather large. Their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don't necessarily have the Perl interpreter installed.  They have versions for both Windows and Unix-ish platforms.  Wesley  === Old Interpreted Language article ===  An interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code, but is interpreted at run-time by the computer, and translated into machine understandable code as required.  It is often a mistake to refer to a language as either ``interpreted`` or ``compiled``, because most languages can be implemented in either way, and some languages (like Perl) are compiled at runtime but behave as if they were interpreted. Other languages, like Java, may be partially compiled into an intermediate form which is then interpreted (although that, too, might be compiled). Some languages, though, are specifically designed to favor interpretation.  An example of an interpreted language is JavaScript.   Is Java interpreted, or what?   The Java programming language article says:  :``The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical C++ compiler and some later Java language compilers, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. More recent implementations of the Java VM produce programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques.``   The Java language is compiled, always.  It is designed as a compiled language, and is implemented as a compiled language.  It is often compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted (with a virtual machine).  I think the Java language article is correct, but maybe it could be worded better.  LDC  Yes, and you can also compile Jave straight down to machine code if you like. The above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is IMHO incorrect; every language that has an ``eval`` statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code; you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code. AxelBoldt  Way too much mess here has been caused by lack of clear definition of ``compiling``. It is used in two distinct meanings, as in: # compiled to machine code (or assembly) # compiled to byte code/parse tree/some other internal representation  I think it's wrong to call languages that use the second way ``compiled``. In such case there would be virtually no interpreted language in use - no language uses line-by-line parsing nowadays, all ``compile`` source to some form of internal representation.  Quote from FOLDOC:      Compiler       A program that converts another program      from some {source language} (or {programming language}) to      {machine language} (object code).

Copernicus died in 1543  well before the Peace of Augsburg  Although this statement is correct, I'm not sure how Copernicus the church canon, physician, astronomer, etc., fits in.    :There were cities in Prussia that fought for keeping the government of the Catholic Teutonic Knights and others, who fought to get the Papal domination out and to become Protestant. During this time the crown of Poland, held by the Lithuanian JagielloÉ??s, married to the imperial Habsburg's had some limited influence in the politics of Prussia. Sigismund I wanted the Prussian cities to give up their right to mint coins. The leading cities of Prussia, Thorn, Danzig and Elbing declared, never would they give up their individual city rights to mint coins. Minting coins was a right given by the emperor and giving up this right would mean loss of sovereignty .   This helps to explain something about the former, in that it sets up a Catholic-Protestent conflict.  My questions:   *What cities, if any, were ruled by the Teutonic Knights at the time  or was it all of Prussia?   *Does this have something to do with either the Second treaty of Thorn or the abdication of Albrecht of Prussia from his position as Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights?  From the other info on the site, it looks like there may have been some conflict over jurisdiction between Albrecht and his heirs and the TKs, who began to get their Grand Masters by imperial appointment (and from the impreial  read Habsburg  family) *How do the Jagiellos fit in?  Is their involvement because of their distant connection to the Habsburgs, as Helga implies?  or because (as we know from other articles) at one point, residents of the area had appealed to the Polish rulers for help in overthrowing the Teutonic Knights? *'''Could the objections of the cities mentioned not have something to do with their being members of the Hansa  a group notoriously jealous of their independence and privileges?  In answer to the much-anticipated imperial comment, viz., that the objections had  to do with an infringement of imperial right and law, I cry bullshit.  The Hansa cities regularly played off their position between the emperors and other rulers  Emperors could grant them independence from local rule, but the cities fought hard to keep the emperors from having too much control.

"`  : To attempt to briefly several of Ed's questions from what I can only hope is an Eastern Orthodox Christian POV: : * Nothing ``compels`` a just God to ``enforce`` a person's separation from Him, save the principle of the person's free will. If a person chooses not to love God, or chooses a life separate from God, that amounts to the same as choosing death, since they are cutting themselves off from the ultimate source of life. Looking at the word ``perish`` in John 3:16, in Greek it is in neither active nor passive voice, but rather ``middle voice``, which means a better translation would be ``whoever does not believe in him will destroy himself``. Living in the presence of an all-loving God while rejecting that love is how some Orthodox theologians describe Hell; hence, God's love is sometimes described as a ``river of fire``. Hence both God's goodness and justice are preserved, as well as each person's free will. : * Also, Jesus did not have to die. To say that he was forced to die would imply that some external force or law is greater than God and forced God to act against His will. Eastern Orthodoxy has always rejected this notion, and rather says that Jesus chose to lay down his life in order trample down death by death. When Death tried to swallow up the the Giver of Life, Death's power was overcome. As for alternative plans, none are discussed, but that's not the same as saying that God had no choice or was compelled by something or someone else. Some Church Fathers speak of Christ triumphantly mounting the Cross like a steed. : * The Jews did not have to accept Jesus as their Messiah. He simply was their Messiah; it was not an elected office, and their choices did not change this fact, did not prevent his triumphant death or his resurrection. Many Jews did believe in him, many more did not. : Hope this helps. I'll have to look another time at whether or how any of this should affect the article, as I'm obviously coming in very late to an old discussion.  17:15 Sep 9, 2002 (UTC)`",0
"  ::: On the fringes of any nation the melting pot effect is less pronounced. The homogenisation of England did not permeate beyond the Tamar into the Cornish peninsular until the later half of the 19th century, and it is this fact that gives rise to a separate Cornish identity. In the rest of England the Celtic identity of the Britons was subsumed by the waves of Anglo-Saxon, Danish and Norman invasions, but the King on the throne of England has been the Cornish peopleÉ??s overlord for some 1200 years. Even so, the Cornish language aside (of which there has not been one native speaker for 150 years), I wonder if this identity is any really any stronger that that of Yorkshire. A Yorkshireman has a distinct identity different from much of England but very few would not claim England to be the nation of their birth.  :::In the 19th century a Cockney and a Geordie meeting for the first time would have found great difficulty communicating, though they were speaking the same tongue, but both would have been sure they were living in England. England was until relatively recently a land of containing many regional identities and has only relatively recently started to become a blurry single entity. What is England and Englishness anyway? Is it drinking tea?, or eating roast beef?, or playing cricket? or a sense of fair play?, or belief in trial by jury?, or a particular sense of humour? If it is anyone of these I donÉ??t see how the Cornish differ from the English.  :::Leaving aside these philosophical issues and returning to the realpolitik as sjc calls it the situation is clear. The Cornish nation ceased to exist some 1200 years ago and the duchy of Cornwall is irrelevant to the governmental administration of the region. It is administered by a county council fairly elected by the inhabitants many of whom are happy to call themselves English. Some are not, but some Scots nationalists dislike being called British, the fact remains that Scotland is in Britain (UK) similarly those Cornish people may dislike being called English cannot get away from the fact that as it stands Cornwall remains a county in England until a Cornish nation is re-established. Despite the aspirations of Cornish nationalists/separatists and despite the anachronistic state of affairs regarding the Duchy of Cornwall, Cornwall is currently a county in England and to fail to describe it as such is simply erroneous. It would be a misrepresentation of the facts to state otherwise.   As for the arguments regarding the specific wording of this article, as long as it continues to state that 'Cornwall is a county of Great Britain' or similar avoidance of the words 'county in England', new readers will contineu to try to correct it back to 'county in England' because rightly or wrongly, that's what everybody apart from a small minority (and as far as Wikipedia is concerned I think it's a minority of one), perceive it to be. 00:41 Sep 10, 2002 (UTC)",0

At least, so much can be read in Darwin's original autobiography, which was first published in 1887, esp. in footnotes in the chapter about the development of his own religious convictions. Another reason (also clear from his ab) might be his frequent illnesses, and his zealous drive to publish as much as possible about other biological/zoological fields of research. He was always frustrated he could not do more.Fact is he produced an enormous amount of work!. A third reason Darwin waited 19 years was that he simply was afraid of being 'prejudiced' (word quoted literally). His theory needed more time to ripen, so to speak. Anyway, maybe this is of some help. Anyone with more knowledge about it,please go ahead.   Imho the first sentence ``Contrary ...`` should only appear later.

"`Well, I am not trying to pick a fight ) but I have NPOV issues with this article.  It reads  at the moment  like a celebration of scientific progress.  I have two problems: first, it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in, to science as a specifically Western project.  Second, although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge, the history of science is rather more complicated than that.    One way to deal with this (if others find my criticisms valid) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge (from Aristotle to Bacon to Comte to Popper; from Aristotle to Darwin to Mendel to Mayr; from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein and Planck; etc, on the one hand, and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science (i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science), on the other.  For example, I think everyone agrees that Aristotle, Newton, Einstein and Planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world  but I think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims.  I'd hope a good article on ``the history of science`` would inform me of these issues, and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another.    I am no expert on this but I really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of, say, Thomas Kuhn and Bruno Latour, could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously, as well as the claims of those with opposing views.

"oh the classic SM/DF response. That was only one of a range of clumsy stupid errors added into the article. For example, we put the first title held by a monarch first.

But in typical SM/DF style it was decided, 'screw everyone else's agreement, I am going to unilaterally change it. (Like Adam tried to screw up naming conventions, and even when voted down still ignored the decision and did it Adam's way, leaving everyone else to rename articles and clear up the mess by returning things to the agreed formula.   Second, there was a long long long debate about when to describe a modern monarch as British. It was agreed to apply it to after 1707. But Adam decided to ignore the long debate and do it his way, his way on the naming of election pages (who cares if everyone else uses a totally different system and votes down his suggestion!), his way on referring to peers, his way on using the word British, on how to describe James VI/I, his way now on the History of the Soviet Union, his way on how names on a list should appear (the different way to everyone else's, he unilaterally changing lists to suit what he wanted, even when everyone else screamed 'what the hell are you doing'.  Other people put a lot of work into getting a consensus. Adam ignores the consensus and does it the way he wants. And gets miffed when people end up undoing his garbled stuff and return things to the agreed way.  Yes there has been an improvement, cp. DF was actually nice to work with for about 4 days, then suddenly became an ogre on idolatory and various other pages. The immediate reaction was 'oh God, here we go again'. Even Mav let out a sigh about DF's behaviour, and Mav doesn't normally do that.

"`:: Hmm, Thinking about it, getting involved in a more elaborate argument around the question the question of rigor or lack-there-of is fairly useless. To me, the SI's dismissal of Black Mask seems like a ideal example of rigor but I suspect we'd disagree about a lot. I'll boil the general argument down to the point that the intended mission of wikipedia is producing a neuteral summary of generally agreed facts about historically significant actors, in this case the SI. The question of Debord's dictatorial control is clearly a partisan position, therefore it should hardly be presented prominently (though it's certainly a fact the many have claimed this). The split with the Nashists was *A* significant event during period of development of the Situationists. But to call it *THE* significant event is to make earlier development of group more important than the latter development. Debord and Sanguinetti's book ``The Real Split In The International`` could just as well be called the ``fundamental split`` if you took later Situationist developments as more important. Naturally, a neuteral account would take neither position - it could still mention one or both.  ::Your claims that my lack of interest in the Nashists represent anti-Scandinavians racism might perhaps be considered another instance of your humor, perhaps? In anycase, the studies of the SI that come to mind are Sadie Plant or Len Bracken. Even Greil Marcus has some useful stuff. Indeed, in the clearly partisan Bob Black essay the introductory paragraphs still winds-up with a somewhat more balanced view of the group than the current entry here (though clearly there's still a ``revive the honor of forgotten Second Situationist Internation`` thing going on).  ::In anycase, I reviewed the history of text and it seem that the first or two paragraphs are essentially tacked-on afterwards. This explains the disjointed quality of the text as a whole - it clearly needs rewriting.  ::As far as links go, certainly inclusive links are another option - it is simply that the entry would have to be vastly MORE inclusive than the present entry if you wanted to include all links to comments and critiques on the Situationists.       `",0
"`    Another thought - is describing the word as a ``neologism`` superfluous, perhaps?

(All the words Shakespeare invented would be neologisms if you lived in 1630, for instance).

"   Hi Eric, no. You are not in any way one of the people I was talking about. You just got caught in the crossfire, and if I made you think I was thinking of you I apologise. Your work is consistent good plus even more importantly, you have a sensitivity to other people's work with a few people don't. You build on their work to produce something that improves in quality. The people I was talking about arrive at an article, chop it around, change meanings, change context, spelling, capitalisation and then move on, more often than not without giving the slightest suggestion that they actually knew what they were doing.   For example, one guy when he comes across the word taoisigh which is the gaelic plural for taoiseach and which is explained as such on its first mention in some articles, frequently changes it to taoiseachs, a non-existent word. He has tried to change governors-general to governor-generals, Prime Minister to Prime minister. He changed links from President of Ireland to President of Ireland, links to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (ie the form of UK between 1901 and 1922) to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, so linking the reference to the wrong UK. He mucked up some links to T?≠naiste (deputy Irish prime minister) by lower-casing it, changed a series of mentions of First Lady when referring to a specific first lady to lowercase first lady, changed one mention of Garret FitzGerald to Garrett Fitzgerald, removed the word ??g from Gear??id Og Fitzgerald and M??r from Gear??id M??r Fitzgerald, not grasping that they actually were two different people (M??r = big in gaelic and indicated the father, ??g meaning small meant his son) and ended up turning an article that mentioned them both into gobbledigook. That is just some of my work he has mucked up. He made a complete mess of some biology articles, reduced an article on medi??val history to such a degree of unreadability that the author, one of the world's top medi??val historians, quick wiki in disgust. I know at least six people who have left wiki over his actions. And there are quite a few such people. Not a lot, but enough to mangle everything they touch. Another contributor constantly changed an elementary fact in 18th century history on the basis of google searches. I checked on google. The majority of articles said he was right. Those google searches turned up stuff that were barely of high school standard. But she treated google as sacrosanct. If a google search said it, it was gospel.   I have had political science articles which I have written and which were based on hard fact, in mediocre garbage, applying wrong capitalisation (again based on google searches that largely threw up high school essays), wrong spelling, wrong interpretation, etc. I wasn't reacting simply to the Droop Quota at all (that was the sixth article that day I had done that had been 'hit'. In that case Michael Hardy as he is prone to do, swept in to a topic he knows little about, changed capitalisation, text and even the formula which is the standard DQ formula taught (in that form because as already happened in the discussion on the talk page, if you leave out the parentheses people muck up the order of the calculation and so get the wrong formula). That intervention was classic Michael; go onto a page about a topic he doesn't know much about and instead of asking why it is written like that, unilaterally change it, in most cases producing a version that is so wrong it would be savaged if any student repeated it in a class.  American english and British English use different approaches to capitalisation. Many of the references were to things only found outside the US and so capitalised. Instead he insisted on applying US capitalisation rules to things whose capitalisation is a result of their existence and usage in parts of the world outside the US. That indeed is one of the reasons why google should never be used in checking capitalisation. Apart from its general unreliability, most website mentions in the US are created by people who automatically and incorrectly apply US capitalisation to things that don't exist in the US and are capitalised internationally. A classic example is the electoral system PR.STV (Proportional Representation using the Single Transferable Vote). Michael insisted on lowercasing it on the basis on a google search. PR.STV isn't used in the US and is generally capitalised when referring to the specific voting system, and lowercased when used generically. Where it is mentioned on google, it is largely on the basis of Americans writing about it and downcasing it to suit American english. So Michael unilaterally mucked up the capitalisation, then another US user moved the page to another name that refers to a somewhat similar but not the same electoral system more widely known in the US. So any non-American user would get r",0

"  ::military equipment and tactics then?  It's hard to just talk about a weapon without talking about how it is used.      A three-level abstraction is required here.  We have the history and strategy which are inseparable, and should be discussed in articles on each war or conflict.  That's the most abstract.  Then we need the least abstract military equipment and tactics level, with articles like military technology during the Napoleonic wars and so forth, to make it clear how conflicts were conducted using this stuff - this should focus on the actual tactical combat engagements, how they affected outcomes, etc..  And, for those wars that resulted in a great deal of change to military technology, either because they were very long (like the Hundred Years' War) or very intense (like WWI or WWII), we should discuss technological escalation as a separate topic, more abstract than the equipment and tactics, less abstract than history and strategy.  See technological escalation during WWI for an example - this can be done for WWII, US Civil War, Napeolonic wars, at least, as well, and maybe also for the Cold War.  This gets into the mechanics of how things changed, how they thought, etc., and really isn't the same topic as either history/strategy or equipment/tactics for the guys on the ground using  the equipment to perform the tactics.",0

I made a note about this on the 1-11 talk page but maybe you didn't see it. Though the yellow scheme was probably the best known, as it was used on their first TriStar G-BAAA, they had three other funky schemes which were used across the rest of the fleet - green bands, pink bands (also used on the second L-1011), and purple bands. They used to be a cheerful sight flying over our school in hemel hempstead when I was a kid - always turned my head to watch whenever they went over, though the 1-11s in particular were hard to avoid as they were so noisy!

"  == A couple of explanations ==  Because I am pretty new to this project and was invited by the Wikipedia policy just to step in and make some edits, I would like apologize for failing to communicate with you effectively, and to clarify a couple of things:  1) I have made in the recent days some substantial contributions and modifications to the Silesia article that I felt would be valuable to the internet readers. I din't expect that some of this changes will meet with such a fierce resistance.  2) These contributions were based on my deep knowledge (in my opinion) and serious studies into the history and modern times of Silesia. My intention was to write about facts and not about opinions, and to avoid any nationalistic bias of any kind.  3) I am very seriously touched that people who introduce most of the chaos and natiolistic bias to this article are the first to accuse others of vandalism and extreme nationalism.      == My suggestion: let's write what Silesia is now ==  The Silesia article DO need some serious improvement if we want it to be the valuable and reliable resource for the internet users. The current (restored and protected) version contains so many errors that it will chase away people with basic historical knowledge, if it's not changed as soon as possible.  1) First I suggest that we write what Silesia is now (as this is most interesting to the reader), and not what is was in the past. Silesia rich history should be discussed in the history section.  2) It is unacceptable to state that Silesia lies between Odra and Vistula rivers. First look at any map will show you that Silesia lies along the Odra river.  3) Silesia lies today in Poland and Czech Republic. It is doubtful if the Goerlitz area is part of Silesia. It is a historical part of Lusatia, and was joined to the Silesian province after 1816.  4) Im my opinion we should not discuss Silesian history in the intro paragraph, but we decide to, it is unacceptable to mention only the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation  5) I do not care in what order the language-names of Silesia are mentioned, but I do insist that the Silesian version (è?l??nsk, è?lunsk) is included in this list.   6) I do insist that the various nationalities and ethnic groups living know in SIlesia, are mentioned clearly and the list should include at least: the Silesians, the Poles, the Germans, the Czechs  7) The theories about the name of the region must be clearly marked as theories and not as facts. The passages need some minor rewrite.  8) The remarks about HRE overlordship in 1146 and 1163 are simply false, no longer upheld by the German historians, and must be removed  9) Great care must be taken when dealing with Silesian history, for example the rude remarks about devastation was caused by Hussite rebellion must be rewritten using neutral words  10) The Silesia article need more sections on the People, Economy, Culture, Education, Science and Tourism.

"`   ===Pfortuny on Pfortuny's mediation===  Apologies for the delay and for the following text which is far too long and I think out of place, but the discussion has led us here. By no means I intend my opinion to be regarded as more important than any other's, but for obvious reasons some people are expecting it. Here it goes. The history of this text is in  which I shall clear this evening. The text ends at ``EOT`` below.    After reviewing the history and talking to , I have got the following vision of the facts (which is the basis for my opinion expressed below): *Alex's editions on the 29 were done without discussion on the talk page. This was clearly a serious mistake which led to the first catastrophe, but I think we may assume good faith here, at least ingnorance, not malice, especially if one follows the summaries, diffs, etc...  *Alex's editions on the 9 and 10 November were done using the talk page but he made edits before discussing them and, given the complete history of the article, the edits were too bold to be accepted without previous discussion; this led to their being systematically reverted (which is common use in the WP for that behaviour) and in the end to the blocking of the page. This behaviour was clearly a mistake of Alex's, and I put it to his not having read the complete history. While I am not excusing him, I do believe that most of the problems were a result of confusion caused by his Asperger's Syndrome. *Nobody can agree ``not to make unilateral edits`` (Adam's expression) in whatever page for whatever reason, this is a bit too generic and has no deadline. *He is aware of the damages he may incur in (damages for himself) if he repeats the above behaviour. *Before Viajero's suggestion, Alex had told  he was going to ``try to stay out of Mother Teresa's page for a while``. He has privately told me he is not going to touch the criticism section al least for a fortnight. *It sounds nice to be a mediator, but on the other hand it is a responsibility I cannot (I mean cannot, not do not want to or do not like to) take up for the moment. *If Alex behaves like he did on the 9/10 November, I will also agree to any rational punishment. I want to stress that I was in disagreement with most of his edits. *I do not think that Alex will cause any further problems.  Before stating my opinion, I would like everybody to know that Viajero's suggestion on my mediation was done without either mine or Alex's prior consent. He later expressed his concern about this to . I feel it is only fair to mention it here.  Hence, my opinion is: :Unblock the page. If Alex behaves in a non cooperative way, then the resources of Wikipedia to prevent this non cooperative behaviour will be used, as with any other user.  But I mean as with any other user. If he were going to appear in the problem page, he has to be told in his talk page in advance; if he were going to be banned, then he has to be told explicitly in his own page and by a sysop, or whatever the standard procedure is.    ::I have read the above and agree with Pfortuny.

"  Hello Ensiform. I'm not impressed by the dozens of books at Amazon, for the simple reason that they're all published by American Research Press or other vanity presses. I have looked for peer-reviewed work by others about Smarandache functions and what-not, and there appear to be about three papers or a maybe a few more. But I think that's not immediately relevant, as I'll try to state below.  Smarandache appears to use publicly available resources to promote himself very diligently. Usenet, FOLDOC, Mathworld at wolfram.com, and even Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia of Sequences all have lots of Smarandache-related entries. Sloane's is an interesting case, since each entry lists an author, and for the Smarandache entries the authors are charlestle@yahoo.com and other possible pseudonyms. Also,the link shown on the FS talk page (http://www.uoregon.edu/~ncp/Spam/SpamFiles3/DigitalLibSpam.txt) appears to show him sending unsolicited email under an assumed name. This suggests to me that it is possible that all edits on the FS page were made by him under assumed names. At this point, whether his reputation is well-deserved is irrelevant.  ",0
"   Please be more careful with your edits to pages like Born again.  It is one thing to inform someone of what a Christian concept means....it is another to preach to them.  Your edits have been increasingly aimed at preaching and are less and less simply informational.  Much of this has to do with tone: rather than announcing something as though it is true, explain who thinks it is true and why.  I hope you will not be offended by my saying this.  As a Christian here at Wikipedia, it is important to me that all those of my faith behave appropriately: I feel that (whether or not this is true) in some way the behavior of all Christians reflects on me a because of my identification with Christ.  Therefore, I would love it if you could become a positive contributor here to help display a good witness for our faith.  You will not convert people by preaching to them here: you will only enrage them and turn them more against Christianity.  In fact, you will endanger the continued existence of good informative articles about Christianity here if you persist long enough: after a while, an agnostic would likely just want to delete the articles and end the controversy.

But there is risk, the desired results might not be obtained.   Would this meet the need:  :The Samaritans have insisted that they are direct descendants of the Northern Israelite tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, who survived the destruction of the Northern kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians in 722 B.C.E. The inscription of Sargon II records the deportation of a relatively small proportion of the Israelites (27,290, according to the annals), so it is quite possible that a sizable population remained that could identify themselves as Israelites, the term that the Samaritans prefer for themselves.  :Samaritan historiography would place the basic schism from the remaining part of Israel after the twelve tribes conquered the land of Canaan, lead by Joshua. After Joshua's death, Eli the priest left the tabernacle which Moses erected in the desert and established on Mount Gerizim, and built another one under his own rule in the hills of Shilo (1 Sam 1:1-3; 2:12-17).

"`  == Copied from Blue Ball == (The issues of this language are unrelated to disambiguation, but should be consistent with the article Blue balls.)  The following appears on Blue Ball but is more efficient to discuss here: :``Blue balls`` is a modern slang term for a minor cramping men may get in the groin after they are sexually stimulated for a prolonged period but do not ejaculate.  21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)  Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary conforms to common sense usage in saying a cramp is ``a painful spasmodic muscular contraction``, and the groin does have muscles.  But blue balls is not a cramp, but an ache in the testicles (whose musculature is insignificant at most).  Ellis emphasizes ``congestion``, which i take to imply that the pain reflects failure to release the eleveated local blood pressure resulting from failure to relieve the engorgement of the genitals that is crucial to erection, i.e., a condition related to the ``pain and tenderness`` of priapism.  (It may be informative to consult side-effects information of Viagra and its competitors, some of which are effective for 3 days and advise medical care for erections lasting over 4 hours.)  21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)  Further, the term ejaculate, like the earlier ``release semen`` (that a well-intentioned editor  used to replace simply ``release``), misleadingly suggests that fluid pressure of seminal fluid is at issue; i think research will show that there is no significant seminal pressure except that imposed in pulses by the prostate during ejaculation.  The real issue is indeed plain ``release``, or rather release of either sympathetic or parasympathetic (never could remember which is which) nervous-system excitation, which in turn entails destimulation of sphincter-like structures that sustain the engorgement (and that ED-medications work by affecting).  21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)`",0

"`  OK, when I refreshed my memory by looking at a map, I realized that Elliott Bay and Lake Washington squeezing in in the middle is probably at least 60% of the problem, so I generalized it some, although it's now a little wordier. Basically, at least for a straight road (ie following the grid), it's pretty much limited to the area of the Montlake Cuta street between Lake Union and Portage Bay would run into the Duwamish, adding the cost of a second bridge. And, indeed, if you include Lake City Way, and MLK Way, 23rd/25th does indeed come closest to qualifying (as connecting N boundary to S). (I don't feel strongly about having the explanation here, I just added it to answer the question that I thot many readers would have.)  As for Madison being the only E<>W, the offset downtown grid doesn't help, bodies of water play a part, tho' not as much (even tho' the Duwamish is generally narrow enuf for a bridge, there aren't going to be many built). Hills probably do make up most of the rest of the reason (at least besides the fact the probably no one really made it a goal). I assume the reason Madison does is related to the ferry it used to serve that crossed Lake Washington, tho' I don't know offhand which came first.

Then people disregard what you have to say because it's unsubstantiated, by definition. (definition of prejudice)  Also, may I remind you that character attacks are against wikipedia policy.  Also, in a formal debate, character attacks are considered bad form.  And prejudice certainly isn't considered an argument. In fact, it often causes one to believe and say things that are not true, as Wile has pointed out.    (Me)Evidently, English is not your mother tongue, so I can forgive you in misunderstanding that ``Delete with prejudice`` does not refer to you, but to the article. I have spent some time observing your efforts to create articles which lack the barest semblance of connection to current mathematical research, and to be extremely rude to other Wikipedians when they quite reasonably ask for reliable references and sources. What I know of your work tells me that, even if there is some sense to what you posit, it lacks any context with which to connect to contemporary mathematical thought. It therefore constitutes, at best original research, which is explicitly unacceptable here, and at worst, what I will call delusional thought. It therefore has, in my opinion, no place in Wikipedia at this time, if ever. As I said earlier, call us after the Nobel is awarded.  I would request that any further discussion you may wish to carry on be done on the appropriate talk page. I do not welcone you on my own talk page. Denni 04:39, 2004 Apr 9 (UTC)  ``Delete with prejudice`` response (Baas)This is not your territory.  This is the terrority of all who have a voice.  You contradicted yourself when you said that your prejudice was not with me but with the page, and then went on to explain how your prejudice was with me.  Then you insulted me.  Insults are not conducive to meaningfull discussion, nor do I in any way appreciate them.  Your failure to see connections is no evidence of intellectual omniscence.  This would be, in fact, an oxymoron.  Your arguments are overly presumptuous. Consequently, I feel no need to rebuttle.   Furthermore, your attitude is unrespectably hostile.     (Me)As you seem unable to separate your ideas from your identity, it may have seemed like I was criticizing your identity, or ``self``, as we say in the business. Try as I might, I found nothing in my comments which discussed you negatively as an individual, even to an innocuous level such as not brushing your teeth (and I'm sure you do.) Throckmorton and Hilfiger, though, in a paper published by me in 1997, say that ``idea`` and ``self`` are related through fractional intellidynamical impulses which emanate first from the self to the idea, and then back to the self, thus creating a a semantological unificationality of dogmatic theses.

Much more daring than I am.  :::I can have more to say later, of course, but first impression sis that there may very well be POV objections to most of these on grounds of opinion. Now that's inevitable in any sort of political or historical analysis and the best anyone can probably do is scratch a little rhetorical dirt over the most blatant. It's the basis for academic debate in these disciplines. Politics, though, is important, not just scholasticim redux and so it's worth doing. Enough blather.   :::I see a major problem in that your perspective is too temporally narrow, POV allegations aside. I trace the Big Break (realignment or whatever) in American politics to the Bull Moose. Until then, both the Republicans and Democrats were broad parties with support from all classes, regions, etc (well, the Solid South was an exception for the obvious racist reasons, but...). When Teddy took the Progressives out in 1912, he made Wilson's election nearly certain and more importantly in the longer run, many (most) of those folks never went back. Think of La Follette or George Norris or Hiram Johnson, progressives (small p) all, and all (I think) Republicans. They wouldn't have been important or comfortable in the GOP of Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, Taft (pere ou fils) and their intellectual descendents weren't. It was the Repuplicans who staged a generations long witch hunt for Commies and unAmericanism. Even thouhg it was an idiot Democrat who started HUAC (Martin Dies  and he had a Soviet spy (!) as a fellow member  Dickstein I think it was). but the GOP found the structure conveninet to use.  :::Think Nixon from his first election, or the GOP tolerance for McCarthy, Tom Delay, Newt Gingrich, Bomber Bob Dornan from California, etc. The 'Rockefeller wing' (misnamed) of the GOP was the last remnant of the people Teddy had taken out. Goldwater just made the ideological contraction more evident/blatant/inescapable. he wasn't actually very much in tune with the modern conservatives now dominating the GOP. Too independent of a specific agenda.   :::This leaves the Dems as the only broadly based party, but remember that old saw about belonging to no organized party, I'm a Democrat. That's a distortion of the historic American pattern of two substandtial widely based parties, plus some minors. Maybe that pattern is changing, or not, but it's abberrant.  :::Enough.

The church was coming out with doctrinal statements about the trinity, and the Arians were twisting them and believing them. So the church went back and clarified what they meant.

"`  (Ivo Banac)...A bit of nonteleological history One of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the South Slavs and the other peoples of southeastern Europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. This is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. We have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. For example, if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. Croatia is mainly a coastal area from the Rasa River in Istria to the Cetina River, a little bit to the east of the city of Split. Down the coast from the original Croatia, we have a row of unfamiliar Slavic territories that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, called Pagania (literally, land of the pagans), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia (the Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs), and Dioclea (the southern portions of contemporary Montenegro with the Bay of Kotor and the northwesternmost portions of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in the hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today's Novi Pazar, in the Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this territory, but represented a negligible area around the source of the Bosna River, where we now find Sarajevo and its environs. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this was a necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal cities and island territories, from Krk in the north to Ulcinj in the south.  Moreover, modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. Thus, unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition goes back to the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea (a twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translations (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated into the Early Modern ``Slavic`` and ``Dalmatian`` histories of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These works then became material for the Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalists like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same histories (Orbin's) were Serbianized through the translations of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influenced the pioneering Serbian histories of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in the history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more self-contained. It combined the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with the experiences of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule to argue for a uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published between 1884 and 1887).  Clearly, something has happened in the span of ten centuries. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia have disappeared. The center of Croatia has migrated from the Adriatic to the north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This happened in stages. During the High Middle Ages, the heart of Croatia was on the Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to the Ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of Bosnia. During the Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operations in the seventeenth century, the framework of modern Croatia emerged in two extended shanks-one, to the north, to modern Slavonia; the other, in the south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, the Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, became the heart of modern Croatia.  The story of Serbia is not much different. Serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then it moved to the Ibar-Morava valleys; then toward the valleys of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. It reached the Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, became truly Serbian only in the course of Karadjordje's uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or prorex) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into the Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around the Vrbas River and the Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for centuries, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner. Later on, at the height of its power in fourteenth century, Bosnia expanded into Hum (Herzegovina) and the Drina River valley. The westernmost regions were inc",0

"  If you remove this article OK, but still I doubt that you catch the most general aspect of curvature in the sense of Nomizu, Kulkarni and other modern writers. Look at the reference  where you find more references. In the references there (look also that one in Lecture Notes in Mathematics) you find a decomposition of the space of all curvature structures in terms of Lie and Jordan algebras. And you find how elegantly electrodynamics and gravitational waves fit into the curvature play, look at the basic work of Lichnerowics. As an ,algebraiker' I like to write the curvature structure in the following triple form, generalizing the concept of Lie triples (the book of Otmar Loos is a nice generalization of Lie theory): [x,y,z]=R(x,y)z. This concept generalizes the notion of a Lie triple to that one of a curvature triple, where only the Jacobiidentity is missing, but a reference to the bilinear form <,> is added in such a way, that R(x,y) is an element of the pseudoorthogonal Lie algebra. Note that the complete work of Ricci, Einstein and Weyl can be summarized as a decomposition of the space of curvature structures of Levi type (for Lie algebras). All this shows, that we do not yet understand this curvature space completely. Especially the gravitational wave aspect needs clarification. Hannes Tilgner",0

"`  : It would be useful if you dated your comments, it's much easier to follow the dates that way, rather than checking the history. I agree with Rjstott for the purpose of Wikipedia. AN, whoever you are, you are surely a person whith a scientific background. You certainly don't need this article in Wikipedia to explain the centripetal force. I wrote the following paragraph in the article:  ::It is important to understand right from the start that there is no 'default', 'natural' centripetal force. By default, objects tend to move in a straight line, as Newtonian mechanics teaches, away from the 'orbit', so in this context, by default there is only a centrifugal force at work. The centripetal force is being applied either by accident (meteors orbiting a planet) or artificially (satellites orbiting Earth, the object at the end of a rope etc). Therefore, the centrifugal force is a natural component of a circular movement, while the centripetal force is what we conventionally call the force keeping the object 'in orbit'.  : That paragraph has since been removed in favor of a more scientific approach. While I can agree that the statements in my explanation might have been misleading or imprecise from a scientific perspective (which is why I didn't revert the subsequent changes), I think they are a lot easier to understand by the person who needs to be explained how the centripetal/centrifugal forces work intuitively. Again, I will not fight for that paragraph, but I would like to see something easier to understand for the casual reader in the introduction.  : Let me explain what I mean with my ``intuitiveness`` concern by using the following example: When a kid spins a rock at the end of rope he intuitively feels the centrifugal force. You will say that's not correct, he is applying the centripetal force, that's what he feels. But by that standard it would be difficult to explain gravity  following the same rationale, when you lift a suitcase you apply ``antigravity`` to it. However, the kid will intuitively feel that he's ``beating`` some force; when you explain that the downward force is called gravity and it's real, he's ready to accept that, although he's applying an upward force himself. People intuitively feel the force they need to ``beat`` as the real force; the force they apply feels like the artificial part of the equation: the upward force to beat gravity is artificial, the gravity keeping the suitcase on the ground is natural. If you explain things the other way around, you confuse the casual reader. The same applies at an intuitive level with centripetal/centrifugal forces IMHO: if you start the article with an introductory statement which says that the centrifugal force doesn't really exist, that confuses the reader (``then what's the force that I'm beating by holding on to the rope? Maybe I didn't get it right...``) and s/he's most probably going to miss the point of the whole thing long before you get to formulas.  `",0

"`  Potential and kinetic are a very general classification of energy forms. As stated in the present version of the article, these are mostly useful in mechanics. Based on the fact that a photon has no mass, the equations that are given in the present definition of kinetic energy are not applicable to electromagnetic radiation. I must say I agree with Andries. Also, this article is part of an encyclopedia. Why should it be limited  to the basic definitions of kinetic and potential energy forms and I see no reason why we are trying to associate energy forms as to being only potential or kinetic. I like the work done by Bensaccount, but I think it needs to be elaborated. Electrical energy, for example, has both forms of potential and kinetic energies. According to ``Principles of science``, 1966, the most common forms of energy are mechanical energy, chemical energy, heat energy, sound energy (compressional waves), light energy (electromagnetic radiation), electrical energy and nuclear energy.

And I have talked to Catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals - especially in the times before the Second Vatican Council.  Why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church?  It was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity.

"`   == Pro-Gay Bias? == To be honest, I am not sure I entirely follow. What is exactly is meant by holding a ``pro-gay bias``? That I am in favour of homosexuality? This seems entirely nonsensical, and indeed strictly speaking to be ``pro-gay`` would mean you hold that it is a superior sexual orientation that all should aspire to. To be quite honest, I think the whole notion of a ``pro-gay bias`` is entirely homophobic, and used to paint those who accept different sexual orientations in a manner that suggests they desire to promote homosexuality. Clearly, the article has a distinctly homophobic bias. It portrays a homosexuality as abnormal and deviant, homosexuality as a ``post-industrial`` cosmopolitan lifestyle, and homosexuality as the social norm. These are all strongly homophobic POVs which are rejected by those who accept different sexual orientations (i.e., the majority of society in the West, and specifically progressives and social liberals). Those who hold such beliefs are indeed social conservatives who defend traditional morality and particularly heterosexual relationships. Stating the views of social-conservatives as objective facts, without even engaging with the beliefs of the majority of society who accept homosexuality, is clearly and irrefutably extremely biased. As is the implication that homosexuality has supposedly ``increased``  as a result of the  ``modern urbanity of the post-industrial age``, when in fact it is irrefutably due to the increasing acceptance of people's sexualities that has occurred in Western society in the 20th Century.

"` issues, because these ones are unlikely to be resolved through discussion, and are usually very demanding on the MC members.  However, issues between users, such as Wik, Theresa, 172, VV etc... are typically issues that should go through mediation before going through arbitration.  It seems people are totally forgetting the procedure of dispute resolution as suggested some time ago. Arbitration is about punishment, mediation is a soft way to achieve dispute resolution between participants. It is a gentler way to resolve a conflict. And it is also meant to be more gentle on others participants as it is a private solution, which do not force users to see an ugly display of accusations, threats, insults and generally speaking attacks between users, as we can see these days here and on the mailing lists.   I have a problem with this. The MC basically finds itself plagued by trolls, and good participants just plainly refuse mediation. So, how useful is the mediation committee ?   I'd like to mention something. In real life, people are more willing to accept mediation because there is a cost to arbitration that does not exist with mediation. This cost is in particular that * arbitration is a long process * arbitration is costly * arbitration is sometimes unfair  I wonder if any arbitration on Wikipedia should not have a *cost* to all those involved. Apart from very specific cases of troll handling, most conflicts between regular participants are *not* due to only one party. If arbitration was more costly, perhaps participants would be more willing to discuss first, before heading to punishement. Perhaps should they be a cost, whatever the outcome ? Perhaps should the decision taken by the AC more costly in case there was refusal to discuss ?    I believe that the concept of formal mediation here at Wikipedia has been a failure thus far.  This isn't entirely the mediators' fault, but rather a process and structure problem.  Contributing factors include: * Mediation is being considered too late in the conflict cycle.  Once positions have been staked out, publicly and in permanent media, mediation is much more difficult. * To be effective, mediators must have unimpeachable respect.  Real-world mediators are retired judges, former statesmen, former heads of corporations.  They are effective in part because they are perceived to have discretion, and balance.  The parties they serve believe they will act predictably and fairly.  The committee at present includes some members not known for this.  Moreover, Wikipedians as a rule do not extend ``unimpeachable respect`` to much of anyone (due to the nature of the culture here). * Mediation requests are presently public.  They should not be (c.f. MeatBall:GetARoom), since it leads to playing to the court. * Process is ``not yet fully decided`` (Wikipedia:Mediation Committee), which discourages people who could, potentially, be helped; indeed, the mediation-releated pages have an unfinished, essay-like feel to them overall. * Some private discussion amongst the mediators themselves might help in this regard (GetARoom again), since it is more difficult to reach consensus in a MeatBall:fishbowl.  The WP community should get over its ``all discussions public and archived forever`` fetish, which is disfunctional.  Consider the success of the IRC channel (which is more private than the wiki or the ML). * There are inappropriately informal expectations of the mediators themselves (``Mediators are independant in their choice of whose case to mediate, and how to mediate.``  Wikipedia:Mediation Committee) while there are rigid and overbroad rules for those who they serve (``You will then have to agree both on a mediator,`` ``The mediator will check your motivation as regards mediation,`` * It may be necessary to send some people to mediation.  I can think of several cases where contributors could, appropriately, be asked by the community to discontinue their edits to an article or group of articles until mediation is complete.  Lots of real-world success with this. * We have a problem with some articles where carefully-crafted compromises are undone by editors who weren't involved in the original compromise, which prevents healing.  I know of no good way around this, but obseve that it is a barrier to successful mediation.  I believe that the concept of formal mediation here at Wikipedia has been a failure thus far.  This isn't entirely the mediators' fault, but rather a process and structure problem.  Contributing factors include: * Mediation is being considered too late in the conflict cycle.  Once positions have been staked out, publicly and in permanent media, mediation is much more difficult. **True. This said, just a handful of people can't all the ti",0

"`  == IPA - what ==  I read the main page of the article on IPA. On the plus side it is clear. On the minus side, it makes no attempt to explain what the IPA is.  (context, scope, purpose, etc.) Nice chart.  Lots of data (for people who probably have no need of it) but virtually no general information. My questions (which weren't answered - keep in mind I'm a totally lay person): An alphabet is used to 1.  Communicate between a writer and a reader (of the same language), 2.  Describe that communication (unambigously?)  Right?  Certain things are implied by its name, but clearly one should define what the subject of the alphabet is (are).  I have no idea if it covers all indoeuropean languages not to mention Mandarin Chinese (etc.)? Does it (attempt) to cover all spoken languages? Written?  What about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff).  Sign-language?  We now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but I digress.  From a simplistic point of view language can be thought of as being three distinct (context sensitive) types of communication: written/read, spoken/heard and performed/viewed.  I suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks.  SO what does the IPA do?  It just occured to me that maybe the IPA is (now-a-days) only used by euro-centric hobbyists and that would explain why there was no attention given to giving a serious explanation of what it is: ``if you have to ask...{then you don't need to know}```",0

The Mandelbrot set actually classifies the Julia sets - points in the Mandelbrot set have a connected Julia set and points not in the Mandelbrot set don't. The extra research was quite interesting as Julia and Fatou were coming up with their ideas at the same time and their theories were so similar, they are now referred to as the 'Fatou-Julia Theorem'.

"`  ::The Ezekiel passage is quoted in the Moloch article in the 1899 Encyclop??didia Biblica as the strongest evidence for the theory that the offerings were considered to be to Yahweh (along with Jeremiah 7.31). Both passages are also cited in the Moloch aritlce in the 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia which reponds rather weakly (in my opinion): ``But this position is to say the least improbable. The texts appealed to may well be understood otherwise, and the prophets expressly treat the cult of Moloch as foreign and as an apostasy from the worship of the true God.`` It is cited in  1911 Encyclop??dia Britannica: Moloch] with the comment: ``Note, also, the attitude of Ezekiel in xx. 25 seq., 31, references which cannot be explained away.`` The article The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Molech; Moloch] treats it rather strangely, remarking:That this prophet regarded the practice as among the ``statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live`` (Ezekiel 20:25) given by God to His people, by way of deception and judicial punishment, as some hold, is highly improbable and inconsistent with the whole prophetic attitude toward it. ::It is not clear what this means, quoting parts of the passage and paraphasing part of it and then adding ``as some hold``. This article shows itself elsewhere quite aware of the theory that infants were sacrificed to Yahweh. It also brings in bogus Moloch-worship in connection to Carthage. Not a good article in any case.  ::Three different Rabbinical interpretations of the Ezekiel passage appear at . The interpretation by Rashi accords with the most obvious meaning, disliked by TRS, but the writer finds this inconvincing as not in accord with his own theology and prefers another interpretation. That would not be a reason to suppress Rashi's interpretation and the writer does not do so.  ::There is a discussion at  which covers in part John Day's treatment favorably but also discusses the Ezekiel passage in respect to the problem of the people's belief (and apparently Ezekiel's beliefs) that commands which Ezekiel saw as bad came from Yahweh. Note, John Day believes Moloch is not Yahweh, but that still does not answer the problems with that passage.  ::In short, the passage has been long used in support of the theory that the offerings of children lmlk was understood as commanded by Yahweh. It has long been in general a problem pasage. But those who feel that it is being misinterpreted do not suppress it. It is dishonest to present a theory that has been held and still is held and suppress its strongest supporting argument. On could respond by citing the Catholic Encyclopedia response (which seems to me weak). But add it with a citation if you will. But do not suppress.  ::The inclusion is not editorializing by me. I am presenting various theories that are held along with evidence for and against. The Ezekiel passage is cited as part of a common argument that children were sacrificed to Yahweh and normally used as support for that argument, indeed one of the main sources for that argument. My own POV, as much as I have one, is that the evidence is confused, there are good arguments as well as weaknesses in various positions, and that one should present all sides ... though of course full discussion would be a book length article.   Your particular POV on a Biblical passages is not grounds to suppress it when cited with a different interpretation, especially when it is normally cited in the Moloch context by sources usually considered reputable, sometimes very much supporting the POV that the sacrifices were to Yahweh. Even when when that interpretation is rejected the Ezekiel passage is still cited in discussion.  I don't believe that anything I have included in this article, including the Ezekiel passage, is non-standard for discussion of Moloch. I have tried to present the vanilla arguments and give enough information to allow them to be understood. One obviously cannot agree with all sides. Moloch cannot easily be at once Yahweh, an entirely different god, the name of a kind of sacrifice. Passing through fire cannot be at the same time a human sacrifice or an initiation ceremony. But people do hold different views and the task of the article is to explain these views and give their history.  It should be obvious now that your original feeling that this material was novel was incorrect. Please let the normal statements used as arguments stand, regardless of the positions.

"`Today I made a change to some of the wording in this section, based on the notion that a ``right`` is inherent/inalienable and is thus not something which can be conferred, rather only acknowledged and protected, at least when talking about law, social contracts and a political candidate's position in regard to such matters. In particular, phrases like ``Kerry wants to grant rights to homosexuals`` (which I removed altogether) I find to be somewhat sub-NPOV. The position of the GLBT community is not unlike that of women and minorities in previous eras: that they have rights that are not being recognized or equally protected. I suppose a truly neutral phrasing would acknowledge that some people feel that such rights do not exist and thus do not deserve broad legal protections or social recognition. I opted to just remove the most contentious phrase, which was redundant anyway, and to add qualifiers to another phrase to reflect the Jeffersonian POV w.r.t. inalienable rights.  `",0

"Thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously.  To reiterate my original explanatoin to James: I'm interested in this more on a meta level (how do we approach controversial subjects) than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards Moore and his film; that is, I'm trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about.  For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View, any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is, in itself, an editorial statment seems wrong; such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article.  See, for example, something like Roe v. Wade  there's no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case.  Even if you really consider Moore's movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda (and to risk the Wiki-equivalent of Godwin's Law here), note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesn't feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasn't all it was cracked up to be.

Fortunately, I am not a religious fanatic. But, I do know that provocative sentences like this fuel hatred and anger in the hearts of those groups you mentioned. Again I may be wrong.

"`  ==Canonicity in general==  I've been involved in a long discussion over on Talk:Stargate (device) over whether the Stargate in the movie is ``the same thing`` as the Stargate in the series, with Centrx arguing that they aren't and that discussing the Stargate in just one article was deceitful. I don't think his argument is at all valid, but in the course of looking stuff up on the web I've discovered that some fans of the movie apparently consider the SG-1 series to be somehow illegitimate or non-canon.

Briefly, I just felt that it was a bad example because (in my view) it both overestimated the impact of Wynton's recording, and underestimated how popular and well-known the concerto already was before Wynton was even heard of. It seems to give a status to that one recording which is not due (I speak as a trumpet player who very much admires Wynton as a player, but is very suspicious of the hype which sometimes attends him) and which seems to ignore the many fine recordings of this piece which have been made before and after that one. It's not a situation like Gorecki 3 or the loathsome The Piano. It just, from where I am sitting, entirely lacks the feeling of a crossover.

"`==Translation issues== In the original German was a sentence, ``Vor dem Dalang liegt auch kein Bananenstrunk, der die Puppen aufnimmt, sondern ein Plangkan (eine Art Tisch mit L??chern in der Tischplatte), auf dem die ben??tigten Puppen bereit gestellt werden.``  I am changing this to simply , ``In front of the Dalang is a Plangkan (a type of table with holes punched in its surface), on which the necessary puppets sit ready for use.   I think (but am not certain) that the that the untranslated part is more or less a joke: roughly, that there what is on the table is not a foo foo drink for the puppets. If anyone with better German than me thinks I'm wrong and there is something more substantial here, please restore the appropriate phrase. Thanks.     Another sentence with which I had trouble: Die Figuren dieser Schattenspiele waren Wayang Golek (normale Kopfgestalt durch einen da-mit verbundenen Stab auf dem Rumpf drehbar. Arme durch je ein Stab, der an der Hand befestigt ist beweglich) , geschnitzte, bemalte und bekleidete Figuren, die an F??den gezogen wurden, Malereien auf Schautafeln oder geweihte und verkleidete Menschen.  I've rendered this ``The figures in these puppet plays were wayang golek (normally a head assembly connected by a straight stick to a trunk, allowing the head to swivel. Arms were attached to a separate staff, allowing hand motions), carved, painted and dressed figures, manipulated via threads or strings, painted dioramas or sanctified and dressed humans,`` but that may not be quite right. If you know better, please correct the article (and make a note here that you've done so).     :Your translation seems OK. Geweihte could also mean ``horned``, which would make sense in the case of demons. ``Sanctified``, as in ``blessed``, makes less sense in the context.    Another tricky one: Wayang-Klitik-Figuren meist erheblich besch??digt, sehr zum Gaudium der Zuschauer...`` I haven't even ventured a translation for this, it has several words I don't properly know. Is Gaudium perhaps the Latin word, as in ``gaudeamus igitur``?     This has now been satisfactorily rendered.     Another problematic sentence: Aus diesem Grunde haben Wayang-Klitik-Figuren, die zu Spielen herangezogen werden und dort Kampfszenen zu durchstehen haben, Arme aus Leder. I currently have this partially translated as ``On this basis the wayang klitik figures have, die zu Spielen herangezogen werden and where battle scenes zu durchstehen haben, leather arms.`` I know that durchstehen is to stand one's ground, but I still can't fully translate the sentence.     This has now been satisfactorily rendered.     And another: Aus Jenggala und Kediri stammen die Geschichten von Raden Panji und Cindelaras, die ein paar Dorfjungen mit ihren Kampfh??hnen erleben. The first part is ``From Jenggala and Kediri come the stories of Raden Panji and Cindelara,`` I'm not at all clear on the latter part. My dictionary says Kampfh??hnen are literally fighting cocks, but can just be pugnacious people.    * Someone else has now simply rendered this as fighting cocks, but I'd consider that suspect (since one can't tell from the original German). I'd like to find a more primary source before considering this necessarily correct.    : I translated it as I did, because it explicitly says ``the boys with their X``, and not somthing like ``the two x-like boys``.    An interesting link:  :Wooden puppet is performed almost the same way as the wayang kulit, but there is no screen in front of the puppeteer, and no banana trunk to stuck the wayang. In stead a 'Plangkan' (permanent wooden table with holes) to support the wooden puppets is used.''    :: Hmm. Looks like we could have a copyvio on our hands.

"`  == More discussion of changes ==  Here's a few excerpts from the article that I'd like to visit:  1. ``Smith's earliest religious experiences, which involved heavenly visions and visitations, the use of seer stones to obtain obscure knowledge and to locate buried treasure, were not uncommon where Smith lived, and the fashionably elite Protestant clergy of the area were not impressed by Smith's early visions and divinations, but neither were they likely surprised or alarmed``  There are a couple problems with the above.  First, whether seer stones were used by others to obtain obscure knowledge particularly ``where Smith lived.``  (I'll explain why I think that's important later.)  Second, whether Joseph used ``the`` seer stones (Urim and Thummim) to locate buried treasure, and whether such efforts were religious experiences (to him they were not).  (To my knowledge his treasure hunting efforts were limited to the time prior to obtaining the Urim and Thummim.)  Third, whether the ``fashionably elite Protestant clergy`` (whatever that means, which probably needs changing) were not impressed by the early visions and divinations (and subsequently not surprised or alarmed).  This claim should either a) be removed for its lack of verifiability, or b) be augmented by the remarks that Joseph himself makes as a first-hand witness.  I honestly don't have a recommended alternative.  The entire paragraph is fairly ripe for discussion in my opinion.  Just to recap:  :a. Whether the use of seer stones was restricted to Joseph's residential area. :b. Whether treasure hunting was a religious experience for him. :c. i. Whether the term ``fashionably elite`` is remotely relevant to the article. :c. ii. Joseph's own recount of clergy response should be included at the very least.   2. ``the Burned-over district of western New York where Joseph Smith, Jr. was raised`` is facially inaccurate.  Joseph spent the first ten years of his life in Vermont, with only four years in New York prior to the First Vision. I suggest the following rewording of the second half of the entire sentence:  ``that campaign also took place in the Burned-over district of western New York where Joseph Smith, Jr. had lived for four years.``   3. ``Nevertheless, Mormon extrapolations regarding Jesus are in many ways more similar to the earliest Christian heresies.``  A rather strong claim , and I don't mind keeping it in, but it should be on the following conditions: 1. ``earliest`` be quantified to a given year, and ``Christian`` quanitified to a sect of the time. 2. We add the following text from Hugh Nibley's ``The World and the Prophets,`` which tells of a time when current generally-accepted Christian beliefs were heresies: :``Ignatius of Antioch writes to the Trallians: 'There are some Christ-betrayers... They introduce God as being unknown.' And to the Smyrnaens he says: 'Do ye, therefore, mark those who preach other doctrines, how they affirm that the Father of Christ cannot be known.`` (page 55) :``The great crime of the heretics in general, according to the Apostolic Constitutions, is 'that they blaspheme God by saying that he is unknowable and not the Father of Christ...but is indescribable, unutterable, unnamable, self-begotten...'`` (page 55)   4. ``Mormon followers of Brigham Young generally believe in Young's doctrine that Jesus was ``born`` into a ``spirit body``, like the rest of humanity, and remained in that state until his Incarnation.``  The word incarnation doesn't fit the context of the sentence, and I'd prefer to discuss Mormonism here.  I recommend we change that to say:  ``The branch of Mormonism lead by Brigham Young teaches that Jesus was ``born`` into a ``spirit body,`` like the rest of humanity, and remained in that state until his mortal birth.``   5. ``He claimed to have received revelation only after asking questions about a subject, pondering, and praying to God for an answer. As Smith's teachings evolved, his later teachings painted a strikingly different picture of the Father and the Son with physical celestial bodies, being one in purpose together with the Holy Spirit.``  I think the first sentence is out of place (read it in context to see my meaning).  I'd like to clarify the second sentence; it could be understood that Smith's teaching's regarding the Godhead changed rather than expanded.  I'd like to reword as follows:  ``As Smith's teachings about God expanded they gradually painted a strikingly different picture of the Father and the Son than that of other churches, with each possessing a physical, purified body, being one in purpose with the Holy Ghost.``  (As a side note, the phrase ``especially in the region of the country where Mormo",0

But 'power' that's a word that can't be used in this sense without FURTHER definition,because it's too ambiguous outside of a context that specifically implies what meaning is meant.                                    ::::I think if we have the word 'exclusive' (the key point) in the opening paragraph, the rest can be saved for the later paragraph, where it is now... sparing people who just want the overview from reading mumbojumbo, but retaining the info for those who want a more thorough exposition.  ::If a sovereign state can make a decision but cannot carry it out, the recognized sovereignty of the state is essentially meaningless.  ::::I think this is a splendid summation of the concept of defacto sovereignty  I think if we  keep the defacto vs dejure info in the 'differing views' section, it ties together the 3 seemingly different views by the common thread of, ``no matter what your view is on sovereignty , you have to have it to use it and use it to have it``  and if we add your summary it makes the 'differing views' section just about right.   A key element of sovereignty in the legalistic sense is that of exclusivity of jurisdiction.   Specifically, when a decision is made by a sovereign entity, it cannot generally be ovverruled by a higher authority.  Further, it is generally held that another legal element of sovereignty requires not only the legal right to exercise power, but the actual exercise of such power.  (``no de jure sovereignty without de facto sovereignty``) In other words, neither claiming/being proclaimed Sovereign, nor merely exercising the power of a Sovereign is sufficient, sovereignty requires both elements.   If a sovereign state can make a decision but cannot carry it out, the recognized sovereignty of the state is essentially meaningless.  ::::But if I may? I think this is one tiny bit better, as it applies to the anarchists, monarchs,etc: If a sovereign - person or state - can make a decision but cannot carry it out, their recognized sovereignty is essentially meaningless.  In that form, I really like it.  How does that read to you? I think at this point the article is accurate, and pretty safe to expand on.

"` ==Nash equilibria== The game theory section is quite confused, which is amusing given how straightforward the analysis claims to be.  The article can't decide whether it's talking about a single-round Nash equilibrium, or the Nash equilibrium of a repeated game.  It talks about repetition, and a threatened ``retaliation`` the Predictor, but it describes an equilibrium which doesn't need retaliation or a repeated game at all.  The equilibrium {choose both boxes, predict both boxes} is quite stable for the single-round game, and is the only Nash equilibrium.  Both players choosing ``one box`` is also a Nash equilibrium for the repeated game.  However, when we have a repeated game, another Nash equilibrium is possible.  If the Predictor adopts a strategy ``always choose one box unless the Chooser chose two boxes last round`` then the Chooser can also always choose one box and have no incentive to deviate.  Deviating would net an extra 1,000 for that round, but would cap the maximum payoff at 1,000 in the next round, where it would have been 1,000,000.  Hence, the deviation is discouraged and the equilibrium is stable.  The real question is, is any of this germane to the article's topic?  If this section could be made concise and simple, I could see including it.  I don't see a way to make it concise and still correct unless you want to dismiss the possibility of playing repeatedly.  `",0

"`Fish-man, hello, and welcome to Wikipedia.  Thank you for taking the time to examine Wikipedia policies and base your arguments for keeping No-boo on them, and also for being polite when making your arguments.  VfD pages really aren't the place for me to be making lengthy arguments, so I'll respond to your points here instead.  #First, you should be aware that anonymous users who sign up for accounts just to argue about the article being voted on are still effectively anonymous users, and are still not going to have their votes counted.  At this point I think it is really too late for you to establish a history at Wikipedia that would result in your vote being counted.  Again I refer you to Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators#Rough_consensus for this information.  (Anonymous authors who request that their articles be deleted are often given consideration, but not those who want them kept.) #Whether they're specifically enumerated on What Wikipedia is not or not, articles about neologisms are not encyclopedia material.  Firstly, #2 on that page indicates that Wikipedia articles are not dictionary definitions, and as a neologism is just a particular kind of word, an article on a neologism is necessarily a dictionary definition.  Secondly, encyclopedia articles cannot describe neologisms because they cannot describe things that are as yet unestablished.  ``No-boo`` may or may not be a word with some currency today, but it remains to be seen whether it will become part of the language.  Once we can determine that the term has staying power and is culturally or historically significantÉ??which time will likely not come for months or yearsÉ??then we can write an article on it.  Or rather, we could, if it weren't going to be just a dictionary definition. #If the article in question is not about a word but actually about an event called ``The No-boo Affair``, then it ought to be entitled No-boo Affair.  In that case, I would still vote to delete it, on the grounds that it is a news story.  Again, there is no evidence at this time that this news story is going to have any historical significance, and considering that the substance of the news story is ``the AP made a mistake; they said some people booed at a speech but really nobody did``, it seems very unlikely that it will ever have historical significance.  (You characterize the AP's error as a ``clear falsification``, but I see no evidence of malicious intent by the AP, and anyway it's still not an encyclopedia's job to document falsehoods by the AP.  If the AP has a history or pattern of such falsehoods, and it is well-documented by other unbiased sources, then we can make a note of it in Associated Press.)  If the term ``no-boo`` becomes well establishedÉ??which, again, we will not know for months or yearsÉ??then perhaps it will be appropriate for us to record this news story as the origin of the term.  Certainly, Wikipedia has articles on other recent news stories.  However, most are stories of definite historical signficance, and those that are not should also be deleted. #Wikipedia wants articles on items that are currently in the news, yes.  In this case there are many things related to the story that people might want to look up.  If we didn't already have them, we could add articles on George W. Bush, William J. Clinton, West Allis, Wisconsin, booing, the Associated Press, the White House, the Republican National Convention, New York, etc.  But this ``No-boo Affair`` is not an encyclopedic topic in the news; it is a breaking news story.  It is important to understand that an encyclopedia is not simply a gathering of assorted facts, but rather a secondary source that compiles significant pieces of human knowledge that have already been well-established by other sources.  There are many places on the internet and offline where you can disseminate facts and opinions about this event, but Wikipedia is not one of them.  É?? `",0

"`  ==66.185.85.80's rant==  Presently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as ``primitive`` and ``rural`` (even ``fashist``) being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, ``performed`` on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition.   Another ``apostle`` of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergovié? - refers to his political opponents on the Right as ``gusle players``.   Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all è≠tokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljevié?, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorovié?'s book ``Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje``, 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijovié? Koéçan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijovié? Koéçan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatovié?, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry.    Not far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska É?? was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kaéçié? Mioè≠ié? (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kaéçié?'s work, Ivan Meè≠trovié?, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kaéçié? in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.    In addition to Kaéçié?, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Juriè≠ié? (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banovié?), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosovié?-Kudrié? (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banovié? É?? Trliè≠ (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn't play gusle (it's    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound.   Olinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar.   The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  ``Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West`` that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)  This admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredeéçki: É??Hrvatske narodne junaéçke pjesmeÉ?ù, è´eljezno-Beéç, p. 9)  Now, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region.   Having this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock 'n' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre",0

As formerly stated(before Diderot POV pushed the article with a massive edit) on the Non IE Roots page(), Celtic is another language group holding a considerable amount of Non IE Roots.  Apart from any Basque influences, Celtic seems to have Non IE terms concentrated mostly in the British Isles, where they were joined by the Anglo-Frisians and Norse.  It is blatantly clear to anybody that the Mediterranean influence on High German is astounding.  The older Nordic and Germanic writings appear less structured and thought out, but the more evolution into current speech, the tongues have been so standardised by latinisation, especially.  One cannot seriously refute that the Anglo-Frisian and West Norse tongues follow the least marked latinising structures on their tongues of the Germanic languages(and especially borrowing scientific terms), apart from writing them in latin script, with a few native letters especially in Icelandic to this day.  The Baltic East Norse tongues gained a considerable conversion by the influence of the Low German speakers of the Hanseatic League in their everyday life, most notable in the Hanseatic Cities, like Visby on Gotland.  Since High German has been standardising itself all throughout Germany, having a marked effect upon such others as Austrian and Swiss German, all the dialects of Germany and even in Eastern Europe are suffering at the officialisation and BBC type overtaking.  See the German language page for more information in this regard.

"` -  If it was always called Olzstyn in Polish, I stand corrected. I was perhaps confusing it with Ketrzyn, formerly Ranstenburg.

However, before 1945  the town was known to non-Poles as Allenstein, as a glance at any contemporary travel guide will attest. Witness also the League of Nations plebiscite in southern East Prussia, which as shorthand was referred to as ``the Allenstein district`` (Cf. Churchill's memoirs). The plebiscite there in 1920 produced 97.8 percent (362,209 votes) for Germany and 2.2 percent (7,980 votes) for Poland.10  These are facts, widely reported at the time and cited in countless historical accounts since then.

There are laws being drafted in Turkey restricting freedom of speech on this issue even as they try to join the E.U.  Major motion pictures like Ararat which cover the genocide cannot be shown in Turkey, sometimes due to the government, sometimes due to terrorist threats.  So perhaps when there is an admission, and the topic fades out, the time will have come to relegate this solely to the history pages.  ::Meanwhile, no two genocides are alike, but the Armenian/Jewish ones have a great deal in common.  The scale of both surpassed a million, both ended in the murder of over half the population and expulsion of the rest, both were done under cover of world war, both had nationalistic and religious overtones, while targetting a minority known for industriousness and wealth, and the similiarities go on.  The ``neutrality`` of information has only been an issue because unlike post-war Germany, which was thoroughly defeated, Turkey, which had signed a treaty of Sevres which stipulated an independent Armenia who's borders were drawn by President Wilson of the USA instead had an internal revolution, changing all their treaties so as not to even mention Armenia ONCE, and then began a massive government campaign to rewrite history.

And given that the book is the original story, I believe that ``Joe`` should be used more often in the article than ``Jack`` (though ``the narrator`` fits the character's ``name`` more accurately).

According to [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Nikita Khrushchev]] a significant part of the accusations were based on forced [[confession]]s and on loose interpretations of vague articles of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)]], which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal deliberation was largely replaced with express trials by [[NKVD troika]]s.  The purge targeted all categories of the society: members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], the government, the armed forces and the intelligentsia, as well as ``anti-Soviet elements`` among peasants ([[kulak]]s), in industry, and in transport. The height of the purge occurred while the Soviet secret police (the [[NKVD]]) was headed by [[Nikolai Yezhov]], from September [[1936]] to August [[1938]]; this period is often referred to as the '''Yezhovschina''' (``Yezhov storm``). However, the purge was carried out on the orders of Stalin himself.  It is rather obvious that you do not have a copy of this standard reference work available or choose not to refer to it.

"`  Shorne and Ruy Lopez, although you have not identified your exact political perspective it seems to be that basically that the policies and viewpoints which prevailed in the Soviet Union before the Khrushchev revelation and reforms were correct. This viewpoint is rejected by almost all scholars even the revisionist historians and by the vast majority of Marxist-Leninists. I don't maintain as some do, notably  that your viewpoint should be totally suppressed but I do think it needs to be put in perspective as the distinctly minority view it is. When you try to dominate an article like this you are violating Wikipedia:Neutral point of view and it is proper that a notice to that effect head the article. But more important than a mere notice is the failure, as there must be, to back up your structuring of information in the article with appropriate references. There is some material developed by the revisionist historians which you could use (take a lot of digging though), but in the main you are falling back on material from your own political sect and just plain arguing. I hope you can eventually see that what you are doing in not acceptable and amounts to a violation of Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not, `` Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. But of course an article can report objectively on what advocates say, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view.

"`  ::And what do ``quanta`` and ``cosmology`` have in common?  Energy.  To simply categorize physics as ``the study of everything`` is imperceptive.  When modeling sand falling into a pile (or nuts sorting in a jar) a physicist doesn't really care about the identity of the particles at hand, just certain ``bulk`` properties that relate to its energetics.  The chemist tries to understand how the material composition in turn generates those energetic qualities, but then usually isn't capable of formulating the dynamic description of what happens when it's shaken (or spilled).  A physicst usually could care less about why niobium is better for a collider than copper, just that it is.  And chemists don't just care about chemical elements and compounds, there is a whole field of chemistry dedicated to monitoring interactions of nuclei with nucleons (nuclear chemistry)  still matter.  As a point of culture, chemists tend to focus on the diversity of matter and how that affects interactions with energy and physicists focus on the unity of energy, and how that affects matter.  Physical chemists very nicely bridge this  they put quite a bit of energetics while still caring deeply about the identity of that which is being studied.  While the duality may sound a bit contrived, there is definitely some truth to the statements, and while not perfect, it's more meaningful than what's there now.`",0
"`::::::Agreed, although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word. I was concentrating on the Polish attitude here, as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand. Obviously, if the article is to be written from a supra-national perspective, at least the Czech experience needs to be included. Czechoslovakia, being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s, had closer ties with the West than Poland did, and was ``betrayed`` in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was: The West politically accepted the country's territorial mutilation, which was not the case with Poland.   ::::::That said, I am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as Finland, the Baltics, Yugoslavia, or even Ukraine (which had never been independent in the first place) is a good idea. While the West could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war, I think that the article's focus should be on Poland and Czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue. After all, there were dissidents in Germany and the Soviet Union, too, who were harbouring grudges towards Western politicians because of their appeasement policy.     `",0

"`  :Fine, but keep in mind that this is not solely a matter of being NPOV- this is also a matter of accuracy.  The Eastern Catholic Churches that are in communion with the Vatican are not properly referred to by the term ``Roman Catholic Chruch``- only those who practice the Latin or Western Rite are.  Take a look at this FAQ on Eastern Catholiscim to see how the term is properly used: .  The only truely accurate way to refer to the church headed by the Vatican is the Catholic Church, and if referring to this church with this title is NPOV, then there is no way that this article can be NPOV and use these terms as accurate as possible. :I was aware that ``Catholic`` also means universal and is a Mark of the Church- I have to admit that I was not aware that other sects of Christianity use the word ``Catholic`` in their names.  It is for this reason alone that perhaps there is no really satisfactory way to resolve this issue, and perhaps it is truly best to incorrectly use the term ``Roman Catholic Church`` to refer to the entire church that is in communion with the Vatican.  I guess in the end it just doesn't matter, so I probably won't press the point any further. :I still have to ask: ``Apostolic`` is another Mark of the Church.

"`  == from article ==  In its modern form, racism evolved in tandem with European exploration, conquest, and colonization of much of the rest of the world, and especially after Christopher Columbus reached the Americas.  As new peoples were encountered, fought, and ultimately subdued, theories about ``race`` began to develop, and these helped many to justify the differences in position and treatment of people whom they categorized as belonging to different races (see Eric Wolf's Europe and the People Without History).  Some people like Juan Gines de Sepulveda even argued that the Native Americans were natural slaves.  :there is nothing new or modern about this.

Tran Van Ba, according to his own statements, is the person you work for. In fact you have been editing from the same computer as Tran Van Ba. And we have no evidence, other than a large number of computer messages from an E-mail address bearing his name, that Tran Van Ba is who he says he is - and if he is, we have no evidence that what he says is true, except that he says it.  How many times do I have to say this? Tran Van Ba is not an objective source. He is not a book. He is not a newspaper. He is not a historian. He is one of the subjects of the article. He has a conflict of interest. You also have a conflict of interest, since you are (apparently) employed by him and by the family in question. And you expect us to accept your statements as fact simply because you say Tran Van Ba told you so?  This ``confirmation`` is the same as if I said, ``The moon is made of green cheese because my mother, who has been to the moon, told me so.`` I could provide a million E-mails from my mother and that would still not be evidence.  Your repeated citations of various websites that simply refer to Mr. Nguyen as ``Prince`` are equally irrelevant. They are simply repeating a claim that he has made, which has nothing to do with proving what Bao Dai said or did, or whether there is a Nguyen coat of arms. What you need is even one book or newspaper or magazine article - NOT a website - that mentions (a) a Nguyen coat of arms, or (b) Bao Dai bestowing an imperial title on anyone, an event that surely would have been recorded by someone at the time.  You say you are a lawyer. If so, you understand the meaning of evidence, citations, and research.

"  == Parentacide ==  Parentacide is the term used to describe a child killing one or both parents. Although the subject is as abhorrent as suicide or infantecide, it is a part of our life that cannot be dismissed.  Parentacide dates back to Greek mythology, where Oedipus killed his father Laius and married his mother Jocasta. Frued coined the term Oedipus complex to describe a state of psychosexual development and awareness first occuring at the age of 3 1/2 years.  In 1989 Lyle and Erik Menendez commited parentacide when they murdered both of their parents in cold blood. Although the murders were at least partially motivated by money, the brothers alleged their father had abused them, which was their justification for the killing.  Jeremy Bamber committed parentacide by proxy and was convicted in 1986 of killing his adoptive parents, sister, and her two six year old sons. Although money was thought to be the motive for this killing spree, the fact that he was adopted indicates that the reasons behind the murders were less clear cut. Being adopted, Bamber very likely suffered from adopted child syndrome, which is a psychological maladjustment to the knowledge that his real parents had given him up for adoption.",0

First Ansel Adams, in his three volume 1980 basic photography series, presented the Zone system this way and he explicitly said, in so many words, that his aim is not to force his own system of photography on anyone, but to encourage photographers to better understand their equipment in order to control the finished photograph. He disapproved of winging it, not of any particular system. The Zone system worked for him. And the Zone system is controversial, believe it or not. I know of at least one vocational school photography teacher (years ago when I lived in Montreal) who told students not to bother with it, and it seems he was not alone.   Also, please wait a few days before doing a major edit job. I liked the article as it used to be and I was sorely tempted to revert most of your changes, but did not. I particularly liked the wording ``dynamic range`` and miss it, and I'm sorry to say I now personally find the article less approachable to a newcomer.   Dynamic range is very appropriate: for instance (I'm making numbers up here for the sake of argument) if we say reality has a Zone 0 to X range of 1 to 100,000 , then a finished print has a range of 1 to 10,000 , while a typical digital camera will only provide a range of 1 to 1,000 . A move from 100,000 to 10,000 to 1,000 seems pretty dynamic to me...  However, since I'm not going to reread the whole Basic Photography series or even go into a darkroom again (space is at a premium in Tokyo) I'm not willing to put too much effort into maintaining this page.    :Hi Vincent: :Which idea, specifically, did you wish to restore to the zone system article? That the zone system is/was not advocated by all? (I'd say that's probably true for most any school of thought.) That Ansel Adams was not dogmatic about this being the only way to do things?

"`   Dear Wikipedia ````Neutrality```` guardian,  Re Saddam Hussein entry, no one has yet to answer my question, why do the live palestinians deserve mention in the  primary intro for a non palestinian leader, but the Slaughtered Kurds of Saddam's own countrymen do not?   You could have Written ``Some parts of the Arab world admired Saddam for standing up to the west``. Without mentioning the Palestinians, just like you refuse to mention the slaughtered  Kurds. But you insist on mentioning the Palestinians, and further conceal any remnant of opposing POV with the fascist's friend, the term  ``human-rights situation`` which you hope anyone can interpret as anything.  Are you claiming that the horrors both existed and didn't exist, depending on who you ask? where are all those dead kurds, then?  revive them! I'm sure they will be glad to read in wikipedia that what was done to them was only ``a situation``. A situation is good. Elain in Seinfeld has situations. comes and goes. They can dig up their graves and go home to watch the reruns.  Never mind the bodies, they will soon rot and everyone would have forgotten all about it. Shhhhhhh. But Only one thing as sure as the Sun existed, didn't it? The palestinians and their glee! thats as solid as Iron! who needs proof? its the Palestinians! Amen! Do you have a paraplegic handy by any chance?   I want to know a rational arumgent of why it is so important and humanitarian to  disguise Saddams undisputed, DNA proven horrors. It must be VERY important. there must be some divine logic here beyond my rationality. Oh, It will upset the palestinians? sure! don't you think Saddam's other little hobbies (other than encouraging palestinians) have upset at least the same number of people or largeer? why do you stifle their emphasis then? Either you stifle ALL non Iraqi effects of Saddam, or you mention them NEUTRALLY that means not ONLY the palestinians!   Are you perhaps saying that 10,000 gassed kurds and their millions of grieving relatives/supporters are less important than 2 million live palestinians with no direct contact to Iraqi affairs other than a blushing glee at Saddam's deeds? if so, how many? how many non-palestinians does it take to die till that issue becomes  important enough to mention if it contrasts the palestinian POV?  a million? 6 million by any chance? does this number mean anything to you or do you just file it in you head as ``Human rights situation``?   and how many palestinians angry that 1+1=2 would it take for you to remove all the henceforth controversial entries on mathematics? 3 palestinians? 4 perhaps? remember how to count women They won't like it unless you count women as 1:2 for men. they might cause something to your ``Human rights situation`` otherwise.   And this pargraph:   an increase in human-rights abuses, notably acts of genocide against Iraqi Kurds. The United States continued to view Saddam with deep suspicion, however, primarly due to his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction  do you have any factual references that dispute any of this? supported FACTS not 'liberal' wishful illusions!   all of it is corroborated in the links!   And this,  ``Thanks for pointing this out. I suspect that it was removed because an anon is getting a kick out replacing non-controversial matter-of-fact statements like the above with overtly emotive, deliberately provocative ones.``  Are you hinting that this sentence: ``While he remained a popular hero among many disaffected Arabs for standing up to the West and for his unflinching support for the Palestinians``  is a NPOV? what proof do you have of his support of the palestinians? are ther any references of this, or just hearsay?  Just call wikipedia the Western Edition of Pravda, and be done with it! (never mind that the Palestinian POV is merely matter of morale, and the opposing POV rests on actual crimes of war! how in your humane conscience can you condone this state of affairs?) And I dont wan't to skewer anyone either. If I wante to Skewer Saddam, I would have called him a Hitler wannabe; Little Stalin,  the prince of evil and so forth. This is skewering. Mentioning FACTS is never skewering, even if the palestinians don't like them!   `",1

Consider yourself formally challenged to an honorable duel in international waters, which I have no doubt you will slink away from like the cowardly reptile you are. Without true conviction behind your statements, you do not even deserve to have a tongue, and I yearn for the days of old where speakers of untruth faced searing-tong glossectomy and abacination. Your furtive and manaical attempts to discredit those voting to keep exposes you as little more than a drooling ocd-riddled schizophrenic and I heartily encourage you to wash your hands and pick viciously at your many pustules and then wash your hands again until the vicious cycle exposes bare skull. The stove is on. DONGS.  *dongs Response from coward begins: Fine, I accept.  As challenged party, I have choice of weapons and conditions.  I chose pistols, and we will fight at a distance of 15 cm.  The fight will tak place in three weeks time 205m off the east coast of Newfoundland.  Acceptable?  30 June 2005 14:02 (UTC) Response from coward ends. *dongs As you are ignorant of even the most rudimentary conventions of honorable duelling it is my duty to inform you that it is the challenger, not the challenged who determines distance, as stated in rule #16 of the Codo Duello. You must also elaborate on the pistols to be used, otherwise I will assume any caliber semi-automatic is permissable. As you have chosen the grounds, you are also responsible for providing the boat on which the pistol duel will take place. If you are unable to find a boat with a large enough deck to accomodate an honorable duel (at least twenty paces of unobstructed space in a corridor ten feet wide) another option is that two smaller boats may be used, in calm seas. Inflatable rafts and non-motorized dingheys are not acceptable. I must commend you on selecting a cowardly weapon which greatly complicates the relatively straightforward process of an at-seas duel, you perfidious poltroon. Should you miraculously acquire vertabrae between now and the chosen date, I will gladly agree to a change in weapons, especially to epees. The time is acceptable to me. Please note that duels cannot take place within the jurisdiction of Canada, and therefore must take place at least 200 nautical miles (not standard miles) from the continental margin, to avoid breaking laws which expressly forbid dueling.   I await the duel eagerly. Please offer my advance condolences to your family members.  \ \EDIT: EPEE, MORE LIKE E-PEEN AM I RITE GENTLEMENS",1

Also, your behaviour in Wikipedia clearly shows the half-Arab/half-Turkish blood.  You act exactly, 100% like a half-arab/half-turk boor, with ZERO tolerance and respect for others and ZERO sense of compromise and ZERO sign of culture or civility.

Does it mean ``portion for the movie stars``?!  You really ARE dumb, aren't you?  And if you still have doubts, since you are from a mullah, sayyed family, I am sure you know that you can write to any of the ayatollahls offices or the howza and ask them any question you want.

You are doing exactly the same as him. Why do you remove my answer TO YOUR ARTICLE from the main frame and let the answer made by YBM and others for exemple? This is clearly discrimination. My answer is all too relevant to the affair discussed as are all my article as the last ones have to do with the crdibility of the people who have been the upmost against the Bogdanovs and have critisize their theory the most. I do not think that a DEA in informatic make a person capable to critisize the work of professionals in theorethic Physic. To do so you will have to be Stephen W Hawking and the alike. I have pointed how discusting the methods of YBM were and was able to come with tangibles prooves of it. Thats why he hurried to deleet them. But you came, afet 6 days he had done that and 6 days I tried to put it back, and...banished me!!! then after 9 days in all, you wrote your first intervention in this site and gave a warning to YBM, but.. you failled to punish him as well, and you commited the grave mistake to accuse me of having perpetrated the same kind of crime as he did, and by doing so, bagatelize the incident as being a commun little fight between 2 stupid users deleting each others column. But it isn't at all what happened. My answer to your intervention, more than being an internal dispute, had as goal to put things back where they belong, and regarded all users. They have to know that this YBM did deleeted my texts for a whole week, without any admin interventions, that you did bannished me but not him, and that you did bannished me again but not him, for personal reasons, and at the same time hinder the users to see the facts by removing them from where they belong and place them outside. You don not have answered any of my questions, and for you to know Cereal Killer is the admi of the french site about the bogdanov affair and is therefor very relevant to this case. As for your accusation of my pseudo crimes of having written in french, I wrote in french on heat after having read your answer, and translated it dtraight away in english, and the french version was no more than 10 to 15 minutes on line in the middle of the night, so do stop try to agress with lies, be more honnest with yourself, at least and say it as it is: you prefer the opinion of YBM, do not like the Bogdanov, thought you do not understand a thing about astrophysic, and you feel nothing but hatress and repulsion about me and what I stand for. i do not think that an aristrocats fan is welcome in a place like wiki who require essentially people having a great sens of honnor, democratie, equality, common sens, and who value ethic.

Can you please explain your edits to Biff Rose? They appear to express a negative POV towards the person. -Willmcw    For willmcw  I think its high time you stopped trying to rearrange my words. The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I've interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn't. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won't help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you've been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. You are not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you have become like a fascist. Terrible!!!  [left unsigned by user:Steve espinola at ]  Why do you delete the number of ``Carson`` appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It's a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It's not a place to gain revenge on someone you don't like. -Willmcw     I've copied this discussion to the talk:Biff Rose page. -Willmcw       Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officially appeared on the show, and how many times he taped performances. He alleges, himself, that he appeared on the show 12 times. Producerss from the Tonight show remember him being on with much less regularity. Therefore, a distinction, to leave out embrassment, would be something like, ``Rose appeared with some level of regularity on the tonight show in the end of the decade.`` Of note> Rose was banned from any more performances on the Tonight Show because he refused to cut to a commercial break during his last performance, reciting a poem he often claimed as his own, which in fact was a poem by Paul Newman's uncle, Joseph Newman. This was chalked up to Rose's irrascible nature. I think it is important to notice to, the anger that first rears its head here, and then seems to pop up, on the record he did in 73, and beyond, to his later self released recordings where Rose is heard calling african americans niggers, and making fun of the jewish religion, citing Hit5ler as a genius, who clearly had a vision. Willmcw is trying to keep the previous words someone else wrote about Rose being a child molester, which were clearly vandalism. I did not write that, and the anti semitic sentiments attributed to Rose are very easily found in his records and his websites. Willmcw is a vandal and works against my own edits in a nasty and un wiki fashion.Steve espinola       Greetings  Greetings and welcome to wikipedia. Please excuse the rude treatment you've received from the administrator who has engaged most of your attention thus far. He has a bad habit of disregarding Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers, especially where a newcomer has made edits to an article or subject he deems to be his territory. You should not let a hostile reception deter you from participating here and I hope you will stay. While editing I encourage you to review Wikipedia's policies and guidelines located here. Please make a good faith attempt at abiding by each, and if you believe that another user you have encountered is not doing so a proper recourse is to inform him/her of it. Thanks and welcome once again. Rangerdude   I don't think that this is a new user. -Willmcw     A hunch that somebody's a returnee, absent clear proof, is no basis to harass him or her. Unless you have proof and are prepared to make a case of it, please assume good faith. Rangerdude        I'm not harassing anyone. I came to his talk page to ask him to not delete material from an article. The fact that he is using a different username today didn't seem like sufficient reason to call out the welcome wagon. But you go right ahead if you like. Cheers, -Willmcw           Revert warning  You are in danger of violating the three revert rule. Please cease further reverts or you may be blocked from further editing. -Willmcw    REad this  Willmcw, I understadn yo uare trying to avoid vandalism, but by manipulating this site into your view you promote FASCISM.  MY edits are good on the subject of Biff Rose.  Look at his website, research his recordings. Time magazine has written numerous articles, are these mentioned in other wiki posts... NO. So why here?  As for Rose's self released recordings, I did a favor to you by listing them. Are Other performers non accesible recordings listed? NO.  Do a better job editing and less of one POlicing because you stink at it.

Please leave it as a redirect to the properly-named article. Thank you. -Willmcw    What the?  Hey, why are you reverting my edits and removing the photo of Biff Rose? I found a separate article on the same topic (where you seemed to be the main author), incorporated the main points from it in an attempt to mege them. Someone later redirected it. Why are you deleting my additions? Marcuse   However much I abhor racism, anti-semitism, etc. I think that whatever Biff Rose currently espouses seems more like it should be taken with a grain of salt. Not quite the same as David Duke. I have no problem with these things outlined in his bio, but it should really not have the form as something showing a personal point of view. It seems like the way the article was, was fairly balanced, showing both old and new aspects of the artist. And let the quotes and links speak for themselves. Why did ",1
"`  What the hell does that mean? Talk English not Wiklish. Are you some kind of homomorph? -) As to RoyBoy, he is not very good at checking his facts. Even a cursory Google would show that Jonathan Sarfatti and Jack Sarfatti are not the same person and live on different continents. Notice how silent the Great Mathematician Dr. Hillman is in the light of Nobel Prize physicist Brian Josephson's remark above putting him in his proper place and in Hillman's inability to respond to Sarfatti's detailed argument above. It is not enough to bluster ``it's nonsense``. Burinski will also respond he is not on e-mail all the time. None of your facts check out. Everything Sarfatti has said is the truth and his arguments on the physics have not been refuted. You people not only have no respect for truth, you simply cannot even perceive it because this information is too advanced for all of you - even Chris Hillman who is not a physicist although he is a mathematician of sorts - he admits he is not even interested in quantum theory so he should recuse himself if he were really honest.

"`   Well, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can't kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:  In recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the todayÉ??s useful idiots.   [Ali Sina] states: É??They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.É?ù  The same author writes: É??More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, ``All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.`` Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.É?ù   Muslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her.   In Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldnÉ??t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution É??hate speechÉ?ù. What about the Quran? IsnÉ??t that book a hate speech?    Funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules.   If you try to write anything that Muslims donÉ??t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. DoesnÉ??t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published?   I am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed?   Sorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2",1

"`   : You're a liar! You have been lying all along including today, and right here above! , please see the following examples of lies from just today, and here I'll quote what I wrote to him earlier:    :: Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you ``liars``; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:  :: QUOTED: ``I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.     :: QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as ``1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression.`` First of all, ``all editors have reached a consensus on the article`` is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others ``have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system``, Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with ``- For a start,`` Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in ``the clearest possible words`` when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss ``differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)``, and then again , who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about. The dictionary defines a liar as ``One that tells lies`` and ``a person who has lied or who lies repeatedly``, if you want me to stop calling pointing out your lies stop lying!  ()``  : In addition, I did *not* start the POV fork (Alternative views on Arabic numerals).   : In addition, you are being misleading and also lying about the following ``I replied to his comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and at 22:08, asked him on Talk:Arabic numerals to respond to my comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8. At 22:09 he said he had already replied on that page. I replied at 22:10 saying he hasn't. At 23:38 he posted a reply on Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and then posted a message on Talk:Arabic numerals claiming that I was blatantly ``lying`` at 22:10 when I said he had'nt replied. Obviously, anyone who would look at the timings will take a second to figure out the truth.``... Why do you not mention that you replied to someone else on Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8 at ``deeptrivia (talk) ``, which I later on found and I replied to you at ``csssclll()``, which you should be aware of because you replied at ``Thanks. deeptrivia (talk) `` but you don't mention this above!! ~Why don't you mention it?! You came to Talk:Arabic numerals within less than 5 mintutes and you posted at ``deeptrivia (talk) `` ``, unless you finally decide to read what others say, there's no point replying to any of this.`` which misled me and gave me the impression that you did not see my reply half an hour before your post, which I told you that I had replied, and then when you insisted that I didn't I went over and replied again, that might've been an honest misunderstanding on both our parts, but here's where you're being not only misleading above but lying yet again; I demand that you prove your following claim above ``and then posted a message on Talk:Arabic numerals claiming that I was blatantly ``lying`` at 22:10 when I said he had'nt replied.`` Where on Talk:Arabic numerals did I claim that you were blatantly lying at 22:10 when you said I hadn't replied??!?! And again on that page you lied when you said ``I asked you to reply at 22:08. At 22:09 you said you had already replied. I said you haven't at 22:10. You replied at 23:38, and then claimed that I was ``lying`` at 22:10 when I said you haven't replied.``, where did I say at 22:09 that I replied? That's a lie.  and where did I claim in my 23:38 reply that you were lying at 22:10 when you said I haven't replied?!?!

"`  :You are out of your mind man.  Most all the links there had everything to do with XDCC, which is the topic.  Some were XDCC clients and others were XDCC search engines.  Is your nazi attempt at control and punishment the norm here at wiki?  ``You don't like my changes so I will remove everything``?  You expect to get respect doing things like this?  Just so you know I will be reporting your abuse of position.`",1
"`   No personal attacks were made.  Also you will not delete my response to this harrassment.  My original response simply told the user above to ``piss off``, which could be the ONLY thing   could have chosen to see as a personal attack.  The rest explained that I posted a valid link to a valid site that had php articles and tutorials and was in no way spamming.  The site I posted is not even owned by me so what would I stand to gain?`",1

That's at the core of this problem, you did not notice that an admin skipped over the tfd process and speedied something when there is no rule explicitly against having an opinion in a userbox?  Rather, there is Jimbo saying there shouldn't be any.  I completely understand that he started this, but he is not owner of it, a foundation was set up, perhaps you've heard of it - the Wikimedia Foundation.  I didn't say you had that same point of view, I'm saying that I was just telling the people who do to fuck off.  I made no attack on any editor, that you perceive it as such is truly sad, but such is life.  Perhaps with time you will learn the intricacies of the language.  If one does not want personal pages on a site, one should avail oneself to modify the source code in order to remove them from the site rather than complain that they're being used.

(you need to be a subscriber to access it, but it is certainly not hard to find). If you tally up the total UDA/UVF/LVF killed in the book lost lives (from 1968-1998) it shows 90 Loyalists killed by the IRA and INLA during that time period. The book ``The Irish War`` also gives the number of 90, on the page I quoted, as does the Jane's intelligence report. That is THREE sources to the one source you quote. I am sick of having my hard work hacked up by some half-assed administrator who can't deal with the fact that his IRA article was full of innacuracies. I have contacted a friend of mine who is a senior administrator, you should be recieving an E-mail from him shortly. Unless you want your administrator privilages revoked, I suggest you either stop re-editing my article, or merge my facts with your own. I am pissed that I took the time to re-submit the article in the way you asked, and you are still throwing a hissy fit. You are one of the worst administrator's I have ever dealt with, you are the reason academics don't respect Wikipedia.   PS.

You guys have no respect for the original Mongol word consequently to the fact that whatever you translate the word into other languages (Manchu, Chinese, English, Russian, Japanese) and how-ever it changes from time to time, but in Mongolian, it is always, always, is the only word -``??b??r`` and it means, and only means, ``south`` and ``front``. In Mongolia directions, front of you, when your left hand is pointing toward the direction of sunrise (which is east), is south. Someone has explained the meaning to you over and over again, but you just never listen and think because your ears and brains are blocked by your racist mentality. You have no respect for minority voices.

"`:::First and foremost there is not and never has been any ``Wikistalking.`` This is paranoia on Chadbryant's part and has been present in numerous remarks he has made, not just those dealing with reverting. I do find it humorous, however, that he has to claim ``Wikistalking`` yet he has a history of reverting an article in an edit war but trying to claim he is in no violation of a 3RR rule as a result of his changing non-existant ``vandalism.``  :::Second of all, I did not attack his talk page. You may go and see the history of the page if you wish to verify this, but all I did was make a comment that was not in agreement with what he said. Because he dislikes me, and because of his paranoia, AND possibly because of other reasons (which I won't go into because he'd just cry about personal attacks), he removed the comments I made. All because they didn't go with what he said and believed. This was immature, selfish, childish and stupid at best, but as I said on another page if he wants to look that way who am I to stop him?  :::Then there is this ``appeared as another blah blah blah as soon as blah blah blah.`` Isn't this funny or what? He has to go and request a checkuser because he can't tell who is who yet he has no problem pulling out the sockpuppet accusation and whipping it around like a cowboy's lasso at a rodeo. Of course there's no WAY Chad could ever be  despite evidence pointing towards him. For it would be unthinkable for someone to directly accuse him of the same behavior of which he so loves to accuse others.  :::``Made allegations of stalking`` [ . . . ] ``to paint himself as a victim.`` Did Chad even read what he wrote? Did he realize that he claims I made allegations of stalking to paint myself as a victim yet in the same remarks he claims Wikistalking on himself? I mean, you just gotta laugh sometimes at these things, you know? But being a hypocrite is nothing new to him.  :::As for the attacking of the external link  he still has no proof I am that person who he claims that I am. This is the same debacle he got into with . And how fucking funny is it for him to claim I am that person, yet three paragraphs later he has to go and claim a checkuser?    :::You get the idea, I hope/think.

"`  :I think the key words here are ``claim to have been molested.``  Justin was an Internet sex entrepreneur and a high paid male prostitute, who had numerous opportunities to get out of the business had he wanted to do so.  It is only society's blind and blanket characterization of everyone under the age of 18 as having been ``molested`` when they engage in problematical sexual activity, which permits Justin to make a quick transition from selling his body to selling his victimhood. Rookiee's article was fact-based and properly sourced.  That Justin didn't like it when the facts weren't spun from a victimologist perspective is immaterial.  :Wikipedia pretends that it's run by consensus as long as volunteers are happily creating multiple millions of dollars in free intellectual property for Jimbo.  Once that task is largely complete, the truth is revealed, which is that this is basically Jimbo's private BBS where he can do anything he feels like, and the contributions he paid nothing for are his to exploit any way he wishes.  :Good luck with your Oprah-esque fluff piece on the attention-seeking camwhore.    `",1

"`     == Jimbo Wales and Justin Berry == It seems the owner of Wikipedia, Jimbo Wales, has developed a close personal relationship with 19 year old Justin Berry, the former underage camwhore and adult porn webmaster recently profiled in a series of New York Times articles by writer Kurt Eichenwald.  At Mr. Berry's request, Jimbo has deleted the entire Justin Berry article, along with its complete revision history, and its primary author has been indefinitely banned from editing Wikipedia for, get this, ``pedophile trolling,`` which is apparently Wikipedia's description of dissent over its censorship.  Jimbo has also gutted the talk page, calling any criticism of Mr. Berry a ``personal attack,`` and demanded the article be completely rewritten from scratch, presumedly by persons who can only parrot the mainstream media's spin on the tale.  Jimbo has also claimed that pictures of Mr. Berry appearing in the article are ``copyright violations``, even though Wikipedia is filled with ``fair use`` pictures whose copyright is owned by others, including screenshots of copyrighted television programs.  Mr. Berry is a news story.  I greatly doubt there are any copyright issues with using a picture of him archived forever on a plethora of search engines, and available to anyone, to illustrate the article.     Way to go Jimbo, you're a rancid agenda-pushing piece of shit, and I greatly regret having contributed to your encyclopedic turd-pile.

He has upset the following articles in a long list of articles tied to Iran; Kurds, Kurdistan, Persian Gulf, Persians, Iran, Iranian peoples.

If Wikipedia does not yet have a rule for barring individuals from working on articles where they're persistently demonstrated lack of good faith, it should.  We all know that this is one of the serious weaknesses of Wikipedia.  That doesn't mean you should be resigned to the status quo.  Jossi Fresco's involvement re Rawat should read as the textbook example of what went wrong and  with a little luck  what was eventually done to fix it.  When cult leaders or other infamous characters, especially wealthy ones who can afford the service, send their paid webmasters to stand guard over their articles, it's a problem.

"`  == Rothwell struggles in vain to withdraw from Wikipedia ==  This is somewhat off topic, but I was surprised to discover that a person is not allowed to withdraw from Wikipedia or delete the contents of his own talk page. Apparently it is cybernetic tar pit.  Had I know it was against the rules to erase one's own talk page, I never would have talked there, since I frequently use it for things like unfinished manuscripts (which have embarrassing errors), jokes and so on, which were never intended to be permanent. Anyway, for the past day or so I have been trying to erase these comments without success. One of the Sysops here, Mr. Connolley apparently wishes to preserve this page because it includes proof that I have committed an egregious violation of the rules, by calling someone: É??childish, boorish, pig headed [and] unreasonableÉ?ù and earlier É??an insufferable ninny.É?ù The poor fellow was so overcome by grief & consternation, he felt compelled to report this outrage to the authorities. (I might also call him a crybaby or a tattletale, but he would die of shock. I have done enough damage already; I fear he may need long-term therapy.)  Anyway, I was banned for this unspeakable language, and Connelley will not even allow me to purge the evidence of my shame. I changed my description page and sent a message to Connelley with damning evidence for him to use in place of my talk page. I fear he may revert both, and delete this message, but before he does readers here may be amused by the new text here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JedRothwell I quote Schiller's warning: ``Mit der Dummheit kaempfen Goetter selbst vergebens.`` ('Against stupidity the gods themselves struggle in vain.') (Maid of Orleans, act 3, sc. 6). Hence, the title of this message.  Thick-skinned readers here might also enjoy the egregious replacement insult I sent to Connelly:  :. . . If you would like a reason to block me, or prove that I have violated the rules, you need not preserve the talk page. Here is another deliberate & intentionally provocative violation of the rules  an old-school personal insult:  :You are a loathsome, sanctimonious, hypocritical, ignorant twit. If you were in state of uncontrolled combustion, I would not take the trouble to extinguish the flames by urinating on them.  :I hope that is satisfactory.  That goes for you, too, Mr. . . uh, Chihuahua É?? isnÉ??t it? Bow wow! Ruff! Grrrrr . . . Consider yourself gravely insulted. If this were the 18th century you might challenge me to a duel, but since I am a craven bounder, I would, of course, run away instead of accepting. Believe me, I am trying to get away, without success so far.  `",1

With all of the rules and all of the noise, what it still comes down to is a mob of people doing whatever they want as a mob, against reason, against fairness, against logic, and against truth. Theres no way to deal with abuse and no recourse for the abused. The place runs on ad hominems and pack psychology. It panders to the lowest common denominator, and in the end its articles are well neutered of any actual depth content or meaning. ``Neutrality`` as a buzzword is used to emascualte a topic so that it has no political implications or consequences. The same standing is given to a pov warrior and a pet admin as is given to a knowledgable expert. Opinion rules here, not wisdom, and not even any real form of neutrality. Wikipedia IS factually evil. The question here, is how to go about fixing that problem. Denial won't help.  Well, enough bothering with pearls and swine for today, my ``contributions`` file should speak for itself. I have been involved in 3 vfds since showing up, each one of which was run on ad hominems and straw man attacks. I have been blocked on trumped up charges by a pov warrior and his pet rogue admin. I have sought from every corner of Wikipedia some sort of actual problem solving process to adress patent abuses, all to no avail. Wikipedia is in fact evil, and it deserves to fail as an encylopedia unless it can solve its problems. Unless wikipedia can figure out how to not be a mob groupthink social experiment where any idiot, fool, con artist, or propagandist can assume equal footing with knowledge and fact, Wikipedia is just a big fat doomed social experiment, which will die because enough people will recognize that it is in fact evil, and go do better and more important things with their time, like start A REAL online Encylopedia that includes logic and knowledge and truth and basic criteria for defining abuse and basic methodlogies for dealing with it.    `",1

A body of Men, a quarter of a million: guardians of the Imperium. These leaders, veritable SuperMen, are all male, imbued with a Sacred High Dominance quite apart, distinct, distanced from the Nation... Authority vested in the Elite must be absolute or it is no authority at all. It is unconditional, not subject to any other power or right. It is not subject to the law but above it.``  ``All trade with those outside the Imperium will have to be approved by the Central Economic Policy Staff, under the authority of the Elite``  ``..

"`  ==  is a scientifically proven epitome of an Arsehole (stretched and itching...) THAT's WHY he whines and bitches so pathetically on Wikipaedia ==  Female masturbation techniques are quite numerous and perhaps more varied than those of males. They are influenced by a number of factors and personal preferences. Techniques include stroking or rubbing of the vulva, especially the clitoris, with the middle, index and/or second fingers. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to repeatedly stroke the frontal wall of the vagina where the g-spot is located. (Studies done by Masters & Johnson, however, have shown that only about 10% of women actually have orgasms through vaginal stimulation alone.) [citation needed] Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women will caress the breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand. Anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some because of the thousands of sensitive nerve endings located there. Lubrication is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is by no means universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficientÉ??some even produce more lubricant alone than with a partner, though the reasons for this seem to be primarily psychological. Women may masturbate in the bathtub, shower and hot tub, sometimes including the use of warm running water to stimulate the clitoris. Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, squatting, or even standing. Lying face down, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and ``hump`` the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine, can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.   A vibrating duck. By de-dramatising the nature of a vibrator, this kind of toy has gained wider acceptance. Some reach orgasm merely by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, which creates pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Some prefer to use only pressure, applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing. A few women can orgasm spontaneously, after experiencing prior sexual arousal, due to intellectual stimulation alone, for instance listening to certain pieces of music. Often, these mental triggers have associations with previous instances of arousal and orgasm. Some women claim to be able to orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, but that ability, if it exists at all, may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved. Those who have difficulty reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse may find it easier to achieve an orgasm through masturbation. Sometimes sex therapists will recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, especially if they have not masturbated before `",1

If you don't understand that, fine, legitimate criticism, I'll write up ``three man cell`` and ``bounty hunter`` and then it will be easy to understand why ``ensured`` and ``insured`` are different - and why both differ from ``assured``.  The sentence you quote is absolutely neutral.  You just aren't familiar with the underlying theory of strike-back (e.g. submarines as employed in nuclear warfare) guiding the insurance, nor likely the three man cell structure that kept the IRA from being broken by the British.

Re: the other article, ``multi-party`` turns up plenty, and there is more use of ``mutually`` than ``mutual``.

There is a double standard in your edits.  If it comes from some US history book, like ``peace movement`` or 'M.A.D.' as defined in 1950, you like it, even if the definition is totally useless in 2002 and only of historical interest.    If it makes any even-obvious connection or implication from the language chosen in multiple profession-specific terms, you consider it somehow non-neutral...  Gandhi thinks ``eye for an eye`` describes riots, death penalty, and war all at once, but you don't.  What do you know that Gandhi doesn't?  Guess what:  reality is not neutral.  Current use of terms is slightly more controversial.  Neutrality requires negotiation, and some willingness to learn.  This is your problem not mine.  You may dislike the writing, fine, that can be fixed.  But disregarding fundamental axioms of philosphy with names that recur in multiple phrases, or failing to make critical distinctions like 'insurance' versus 'assurance' versus 'ensurance' (which are made in one quote by an Air Force general in an in-context quote), is just a disservice to the reader.

"`:If you ever claimed in a Judaic studies program that ultra-Orthodox Jews don't have rabbis, or don't have synagogues, you would be laughed out of the room.   ::I am beginning to see the problem you have. You see, you do not know how to read what other people say without attaching your personal bias to it. Never once did I say that ultra-Orthodox Jews have no rabbis or synagogues. I DID say that the role of the rabbi and synagogue in ultra-Orthodox Judaism is minimal when compared with, say, Conservative Judaism. They are not clergy, in the traditional Western sense of the word. That is a fact. As for synagogues, they exist, but they are not essential. Minyan (a quorum of ten adult males in ultra-Orthodox law) is essential. You can have a minyan without a synagogue, but a synagogue without a minyan is an empty building. You can laugh all you want, but it doesnt change the facts. It may seem strange to you, but take the statement to anyone who actually knows something. I want to know who laughs then.   :If you ever claimed in a recognized Judaica studies program that a significant number of ultra-Orthodox rabbis accept and follow Modern Orthodox responsa (instead of their own), people would look at you as if you had two heads.   ::Also a silly point. If you were to draw such sharp distinctions between ultra-Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism in a recognized Judaic Studies program, they would not know what you are talking about. A) That statement is false, because responsa in Orthodoxy does not work on the basis of someone's synagogue affiliation. B) What is a Modern Orthodox responsa versus an ultra-Orthodox responsa? C) In cases where things like hashgacha (kosher certification, etc.) are debated, you will find in most cases that it is not a question of responsa. If you know something about responsa literature in general (which apparently you do not), there are degrees of acceptance. For example, halav yisrael (milk under rabbinical supervision during milking to ensure that it comes from a cow). Most modern-Orthodox Jews do not insist on it t on the basis of a responsa by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein who determined that American government supervision is sufficient. Most ultra-Orthodox Jews do insist on it. They do not reject the responsa. In fact, Moshe Feinstein (Reb Moshe, as he was called) was considered the leading halachic authority for the American ultra-Orthodox community in the past fifty years. They will say that the ruling is right BUT they want to be machmir (more strict on themselves, meaning more pious). It is not a rejection. It is simply being stricter. Ovadya Yoseph said women could wear pants instead of skirts. Would any of his daughters or daughters-in-law be caught dead in pants? No way. They are machmir.   :You just can't make this stuff up, Danny.   ::I dunno. I seem to be giving answers to everything you say, and my answers are based on sources. I am not making things up.

"` Changed Macedonia link to Macedon; ancients didn't call their land Macedonia, and the entry we have on ``Macedonia`` isn't useful for Alexander. Should probably have an article on Macedon, and take the one sentence about Alexander out of Macedonia, maybe with a ``see also.``   I don't particularly have a problem with Macedon/Macedonia, but don't the naming conventions suggest that articles be named based on their most popular usage, rather than their most correct usage (if there's a difference)?  Perhaps using Macedonia to refer to recent history and Macedon for ancient history would work (with ``see also`` back and forth)?

Just a note about the relationship between Aristotle and Alexander. Those two were two different personalities and they used to clash a lot but Alexander did something that makes me wanter if their relationship was as bad as people think today. While he was invading Asia he would send to his teacher all new and interesting animals that he would incounter in his expedition because he knew that old Aristotle was almost obsessed with the classification of things. The result was that Aristotle formed a kind of a zoo back in Macedonia from the gifts of his student. Now, if young Alexander was so sick of his teacher why did he bother?    Good point.  I think Alexander was complicated enough that trying to determine who he liked and who he didn't (and which was safer) isn't all that easy.  He was known to treat his enemies rather well and to kill his friends when they ticked him off.  I think he might have respected Aristotle and just not wanted to spend time around him anymore.

"`   I cut the following paragraph, which misleads people about biology: :A few points are worth clarifying about ``nature`` and ``nurture``. First, ``nature`` does not reduce to anything as simple as ``present at birth``. Height is thought to depend very extensively on genetics, for example, but one is not born adult-sized; one must slowly grow up.  The problem is clear in the example: height certainly does manifest itself over time as one ages.  But insofar as height has a ``natural`` component, it is' present at birth in the genome.  It is just that whatever genes code for height do not manifest themselves immediately.  But they are there at birth.  The real problem with using height as an example of something that is ``nature`` but not immediately manifest at birth is that height is of course determined by ``nature`` and'' ``nurture,`` or, if you prefer, genes and environment.  this is the whole point of Boas's important studies on height; height is clearly highly heritable, but children of immigrants to the US had much higher average adult heights than their parents, presumably because of better nutrition in the US.  I believe nature is best understood as things that are indeed innate (present at birth) as long as we recognize that things that are present at birth genetically may manifest themselves over time.  How else are we to distinguish a physical feature like height (that heritable part of it) from physical features like scars  which appear later in life and do mark the body noticably, but which are clearly not ``natural?`` `",0

"    ===Deletion of a phrase ===  Last week, a one-time Anon, 218.170.11.195 commented on the difference between the old and new census on the number of Taiwanese of Chinese ancestry:  : The disparity in the numbers may be due to racism, the understanding in Han families that children belong to the man and the need by later governments to forge greater ethnic ties to China. [emphasis added]  How does patriarchy play a role? Is it implying that Han fathers married aborginal women, whose children they had were claimed by the father and deemed by society to be father's only? This reason is not obvious and whose validity I cannot prove. It requires some elaborate explanations, but then, if so, it'd not fit in the basic intro of Taiwan.

"`    Another thought - is describing the word as a ``neologism`` superfluous, perhaps? I've always been an advocate of approaching writing a Wikipedia article as if everything you're writing about happened a thousand years ago and is ancient history, because it seems to me that's the proper style for an encyclopaedia, which is intended to be timeless and authoritative. ``Neologism`` is an inescapably relative word - *all* words are neologisms looked at from one perspective in time, soon after they are invented. (All the words Shakespeare invented would be neologisms if you lived in 1630, for instance). I sincerely hope this page will be around in some form in another hundred years, at which point homophobia will no longer be a neologism.

I don't care how PC or relativist you are, there clearly is a difference between those cultures and societies which embrace and accept change from the outside and have joined the ``global mainstream``, and those which have not. As for those so-called ``indigenous people`` who have adopted modern ways, I'd make the argument that they're simply then no longer indigenous peoples (in the sense this article and the US uses the term, as misleading as it is).   05:52 25 Jun 2003 (UTC)`",0

When I shake my fist at someone on the freeway and call them an ``a__hole,`` I'm using figurative language (the figure of speech is synecdoche) without being poetic in any sense of the word.  ``In literal language, truth conditions work out well, while in figurative language, they may not.``   IMO the definition of terms in this sentence will be unclear to most general readers of an encyclopedia. What are ``truth conditions``? If it's a technical term, we'd better define it.  Also, I moved the following to this page  - == To add ==  * Why would someone want to divide language into literal and figurative? What is gained thereby? (Lakoff provides some insight here.) * Why would people prefer not to view language with this divide? * How does this connect to theories of truth?``  -  These are all needed additions.

Agence France Press released a photograph showing him during this attack. When asked about this event, Said told reporters that this was ``a symbolic gesture of joy``, and aimed at an empty place. Eyewitnesses claim that Said was lying; The London Daily Post reported that Said was observed hurling stones, in a group, at Israel soldiers in an Israeli watchtower.  :Said was criticised for this action by the moderate Arab Press. A report in the Beirut Daily Star stated that they were disappointed that a scholar ``who has labored ... to dispel stereotypes about Arabs being 'violent'`` reversed couse, and let himself ``be swayed by a crowd into picking up a stone and lofting it across the international border.`` The student newspaper where he teaches, the Columbia Daily Spectator, commented that Said's ``hypocritical violent action`` was ``alien to this or any other institution of higher learning.``   :Several months later, in an interview with an Israeli newspaper (Haaretz English Edition, August 18, 2000) Said reversed his story, and denied his previous description. He now claims ``in fact what happened was that my son and some of the other young men were trying to see who could throw stones furthest. And since my son is a rather big fellow - he is an American who plays baseball - he threw furthest.

Evil exists. And militant Islamism (the militant Islamism of bin Laden, the Saudis, Saddam Hussein, the Baathists, and the Palestinian suicide bombers) or Islamofascism is the enemy of freedom and the distilled essence of evil. Totalitarian ideologies and fanaticisms have come in gone and have been defeated by America. All these ideologies are one in the same. They hate modernity, hate America, hate freedom, hate capitalism, hate liberal democracy, and love terrorism, oppression, genoicide, and fanatic hatred. In Germany the tyranical enemies of freedom and capitalism rallied behind Nazism, in Italy they rallied behind fascism, in Russia they rallied behind totalitarian socialism and communism, and now in the Middle East, where a lot of dictators and tyrants are threatened by freedom and American values, they rally behind militant Islamics. It is fact that there isnt a single Arab democracy. Muslim leaders (Saddam was just the worst of the lot. There will be more dictators/terrorists to fight like the Syrians) are all tyrants and terrorists who stifle the free press, kill their own people, crush their citizens hopes and dreams, and want to kill Americans like they did on 9/11. Their desire to kill Americans and supprot terror rests on one deep, abiding hatred: their irrational fear of America, which sticks up for freedom and opposes their tyranny with great scarafices, like America is doing right now defeating evil in the Arab countries of Iraq and Afghnaistan.   The ideology of militant Islamist terrorism is the totalitarian enemy that America confronts today. And patriotic Americans say it will be defeated like America defeated totalitarianisms in the past through heroic struggle: Communism, fascism, Nazism.   A lot of conservative commentators who speak with moral clarity call America's struggle against the evil of Islamofascist totalitarianism right now World War IV. That this is freedom's fourth struggle against a totalitarian evil. In WWI it was the despotic rule of the Kaiser, in WWII it was the Nazis, in freedom's third struggle it was the communists in the Cold War (although it wasnt a ``hot war`` it was another global stuggle like a world war). Now America's forth stuggle is a worldwide campaign against states like Iraq that hate the free world, kill their own people, desire weapons of mass destruction, and support terrorism.   The antiwar liberal left appeases totalitarian evil, which they love to do. They rallied to defend the Communists in Vietnam. Now the amoral liberal left is opposing America's commander in chief George W Bush in his struggle in Iraq. Hundreds of millions were slaughtered (Communism murdered 100 million people while the liberals opposed the Cold War at every step) and Communism threatened the freedom of America and her allies. Conservatives say that America must stop this new totalitarian enemy before its murderous hate claims as many victims as Communism.    `",0

"`  Now that the edit war seems to have died down. I just want to add a little about privatization and free market. Even while the neoliberals ofcourse want to put an equal sign between free market and privatization, very few privatizations are ever made that actually increases the competition in the market. Because if the buisness that is sold to private owners has a monopoly before it is sold, it ofcourse will to after it has been privatized. And if the company is sold while it is already subjected to competition it will to after it has been privatized. Indeed, privatization has nothing to do with ``free markets``, but is only a transferment of public property to private hands. Ofcourse that argument will not keep the neoliberals from claiming the Second Return of Messiah as long as we privatize and the Doomsday if we dont.

 Axelrosen:  I edited the technical analysis and charting page immediately after it had been merged.  Whoever did the job had linked remarks about technical with the EMH.  I then tried to make sense of what had been written.  In fact technical analysts don't talk about the EMH and woujld hardly know what it is.  It is for that reason that I wrote that they IMPLICITLY assumed (actaully without knowing it) weak form efficiency (or actually completely inefficient markets...that few people espouse belief in).  It would probably be wise to alter the text to disconnect the EMH comments from chartism as the practitioners do. King Brosby.  ,0
"  :Consider some recent actions: I helped exposed a Christian Identity neo-Nazi (and his close friend who always support him)...and not a single person believed me, even after massive amounts of incontrovertible proof were given.  Some people wrote me offline to tell me that they agreed with these statements...but none of these people were willing to agree with me on the WikiEn (Wiki-English) list. I am sad that people are so afraid of the Wikipedian group-think and smear campaign that they are unwilling to say certain things in public. Offline (i.e. in the real world), many people also agree with me on this issue. That is why they refuse to participate on Wikipedia. They think that I was nuts to participate here, because even in blatant cases of anti-semitism, the Wikipedia elite usually pretended otherwise, through self-deception, almost sterotypical pseudo-liberal stupidity, or by what we consider fairly clear examples of anti-Semitism.    :I was told, by a few professional colleagues in Jewish education, that their evalution of contributor comments led them to believe that the hostility to Jewish issues was so great that it would be impossible to talk to most people on Wikipedia about this. They warned me that if I tried to discuss these issues openly, I would be attacked as paranoid or a liar. And to my sorrow I learned that they were correct. That is why I stopped participating here.    :However, I am thinking about returning for a small number of articles, on topics that I already promised people that I would contribute to.  I had previously prepared some material to add on the Zohar and the Chosen people articles, and I don't want to leave these topics unfinihed, missing what I see as some crucial points, and what others have pointed out are obvious gaps in the articles.

"` I've found a misplaced reference showing that ``generatics`` did not start with me in content, only in name. The book, ``Learn from the Masters``, edited by Dwetz, Fauvel, Bekken, Johannsson, Katz (Mathematical Association of America, 1991), says on p. 286, ``It was not until 1894 that J. Tannery introduced the arithmetic of rationals as pairs [vectors] of integers.`` (Jules Tannery (1818-1910), French, is cited ONLINE.)In 1957, I received a grant from the National Science Foundation to organize the first NSF Workshop in Puerto Rico, planned for high math school teachers (some from States). I taught ``Foundations of Mathematics``. I was sent papers (later lost) from previous Workshops. One set described Tannery's work and Hamilton's formulation of complex numbers as pairs or vectors of reals. The formulator filled in by deriving integers from pairs or vectors of natural numbers. The latter shows how ``the law of signs`` derives from CLOSURE on DEFINED DIFFERENCES (DDs) of naturals  (a - b), s.t. subtrahend is not greater than minuend, hence, a natural number. Critical is multiplication law for DD. From standard multiplication algorithm, find that, for DDs, (a - b) * (c - d) = (a*c + (-b)*(-d)) + (a*(-d) + (-b)*c). Applying, 10 = 5*2 = (9 - 4)*(2 - 0) = 18 + (-4)*(2) + 0 = 10, hence, (-4)*(2) must act as a subtrahend -8, leading to ``negative times positive equals negative`` rule. Applying product rule to 30 = 6*5 = (9 - 3) - (7 - 2) = (63 + (-3)*(-2)) - (18 + 21) = (63 - 39) + (-3)*(-2) = 24 + x = 30, hence, x = 6 = (-3)*(-2), leading to ``negative times negative equals positive`` rule. This is forced by CLOSURE on DDs. However, in the ``Generating arithmetic`` article which I initiated, some one put in that CLOSURE is a concept from category theory, very advanceed math. Yet, the above book, on p. 260, says, ``For Galois (1830), Jordan (1870), and even in Klein's ``Lectures on the Icosohedron`` (1884), groups were defined by the one axiom of closure. The other axioms were implicit in the context of their discussions  finite groups of transformations.`` So CLOSURE goes back at least to 1830.Jonhays0`",0

Geoffrey of Monmouth used Britannia major and Britannia minor to refer to the island of Britain and Brittany respectively.  Which name fell into abeyance - Great Britain?

Furthermore, your comments above don't seem any improvement to me on the language in the article now, which is very clear that republics come in many shapes and sizes (in fact, limiting them all to two so-called models seems more restrictive to me than it should be).  Use of the words ``genus`` and ``species``, as I've remarked to you before, is a misapplication of taxonomy to political science.  It may be useful for purposes of casual analogy, but we cannot resort to it in an encyclopedia article, or we will confuse and mislead our readers.  You have yet to demonstrate that any authority refers to a government such as that current in the United Kingdom as a republic.  As noted in this paragraph, Aristotle himself describes Sparta as a monarchy  one in which the monarch held weakened powers, yes, but fundamentally part of the ``monarchy`` category.  Your ideas have the merit of being an unusual take on republics which has given all of us cause to consider political terminology, but I am afraid your quotations, though well cited, do not appear to me to compel us to accept your two model theory of republics  it's original research, something Wikipedia is not.   `",0

The point is that there is a debate on whether or not nazism is a form of socialism and the only way to write an article on the matter is to outline both sides of the debate. Taking out the competing debating points, in fact, makes the article NPOV by presenting the topic as if there is one right answer.   And I'm sorry, it's just ahistorical to say that conservatives opposed Nazism. Some did, but most didn't, most notably von Papen. The Nazis didn't win an electoral majority.

"`   Yeah, as I said, I didn't mean to intervene in the middle of your edits, and I'm sorry about that.  As to right and left wing, I agree the terms should be used with care.  But calling the Freikorps ``right wing`` and Lenin and the Communists ``left wing`` is not a particularly careless use of the terms, as far as I am aware.  If you can find a source that calls the Spartacists reactionary, or discusses the Freikorps as left liberals, I'd love to see it.  You'll note that I didn't reinsert the description of the Nazis themselves as right wing.  But I think that saying there are similarities between Nazism and Stalinism, say, is not to deny that Nazism is in some vague sense a movement ``of the right`` and Stalinism a movement ``of the left.``  At any rate, ``what was seen at the time as`` is an incredibly awkward phrasing - it's simply bad writing.  As to other changes, things like saying ``this is how the Nazis were different from other Socialists`` is completely POV, in that it says that the Nazis were socialists.  And you can't just cite laws as supporting a point without explaining them at all.  And it would be nice if you could actually cite scholars who discuss similarities between Nazism and socialism, rather than vague ``supporters`` of such arguments (at the very least, those opposed to such comparisons can cite ``the organized socialist movement`` rather easily, although I would agree that there are somewhat similar problems on that side of the debate.)

"4/28/04: Tom Ruen here. I edited the IRV page today, added a second for special cases including rules to break ties. I'm not sure if it is appropriate for the level of article, but it definitely was a vital point missing from the existing article. That is, tie-breaking consideration is vital, but I also included optional rules for quickly eliminating many weak candidates on the first round. Some may object to this approach, although in reality it is very difficult for different elimination rules to affect the winner.  You can always imagine examples where a weak first round candidate wins, but usually it takes core support AND Compromise appeal to win and few candidates survive merely on compromise appeal.  Examples include:  Round 1) A=38%, BD=29%, CD=16%, D=9%, ED=8% Round 2) A=38%, BD=29%, D=17%, CD=16% Round 3) A=38%, D=33%, BD=29% Round 4) D=62%, A=38%   Here a 4th place, 9% supported candidate wins IRV on a cascade of transfer votes, always avoiding last place.  Imagined elections like this are actually the biggest fear from people happy with plurality, that some voters can offer 2,3,4,5 votes to affect the winner while others only get 1 vote.  The reality is that IRV retains the power of the two-party system to thrive because when there are 3 strong parties, voters can't safely vote for a favorite if that favorite isn't also likely to be ranked highly on votes supporting the candidate they hope to eliminate.  First round rules that immediately eliminate a bunch of weak candidates at once help reduce fears that IRV helps weak parties.  -  ",0

They tend to wipe entire paragraphs, and replace them with their own propaganda.  This is just who they are.  They cannot provide evidence as convincing a page from Hitler's desk ordering the final solution to ``The Jewish Problem`` so they don't listen or compromise and eventually leave in a bad mood.  At the same time, I can't exactly claim to be NPOV either.  It is fairly clear from what I have already written here that I hold Holocaust deniers in no high esteem.  Quite frankly, I find their so called ``beliefs`` to be an attack against me and my people.  It is, to me, like someone claiming there was never racial segregation in the United States, and that even if there was, the slave owners didn't know their slaves were being beaten.  It would be an absolutely ridiculous claim, and yet people get away with it in reference to the Jews.    It is good, therefore, that someone has shown up who is interested in this issue, but who has no real stake in the argument.  I would caution you, however, against being overly zealous in your changes.  Holocaust deniers are, by and large, anti-Semitic.  My personal favourite group believes that Jews are shape shifting lizards from Mars who are infiltrating the world governments in order to enslave humanity.  And yes, this group has a following.  The ``Holocaust Revisionist`` lines and the ``Jewish persecution was wrong`` lines are simply ways of attracting new followers who can then be trained to believe just about anything once they've got their foot in the door.  The people running these groups are solely occupied with promoting anti-Semitism in the hopes that some day they can finish off what Hitler started.  I encourage you to write carefully about what they believe, but please don't be fooled by them.  I wish you the best of luck.   `",0

"`===Plautus satire's irresponsible comments are those of a crackpot.===  Plautus satire's comments are idiotic nonsense. I have refereed papers for five mathematics journals, and my published papers have been refereed (and some unpublished ones that I submitted). Obviously history is consulted; obviously proof-checking is not the main point of refereeing; obviously novel ideas are examined in the context of accepted notions. To say that mathematics is not a science but a ``language`` ignores the fact that hundreds of journals are devoted to publishing new discoveries in mathematics. Obviously in judging publication-worthiness one considers how new discoveries may be relevant to potential future research; one considers esthetics (which for most mathematicians is the main motive for doing mathematics or for learning mathematics). Whence this loony idea that there is no need to consult history? Do you not see sections on how a new discovery fits into the historical development of the subject in many research papers in mathematics?  Plautus satire's comments are those of a crackpot.    `",0

"  :I'd say you like Nintendo too much. ;)  :It's a good idea, now I think about it. I've been trying to think back to when bosses became popular (a mite difficult seeing as I would have been about five years old), and it seems that the flash point is in 1985.  :However, I am quite heavily biased toward scrolling shooters, so I'm probably missing something important. Bosses are, on the other hand, probably more important in scrolling shooters than any other genre, because they have to break up the linearity of the game.  :Anyway. In 1985, you've that Mario game thingy, and Gradius, which is the first time I can recall having to fight a huge boss character. Then in 1986 you've got Darius, which is the earliest game I know of that had different bosses for every level. I think it had minibosses too.  :And then it really gets going. In 1987, I can name R-Type, Raiden, and Rainbow Islands as having distinct bosses, and by this point it was all pretty standard. But I'm just namedropping (and article-dropping too, seeing as I wrote most of those articles ;) ). The point is that there seems to be a dark age of bosses before 1985, so it would probably be interesting to unravel that.  :The very earliest enemy-that-could-conceivably-be-thought-of-as-a-boss that I can think of (not including that Dungeons and Dragons thing mentioned in the article, which I know nothing about) is the Flag Ship from Gorf, an arcade game released in 1981, in the prime of the Space Invaders Era. Gorf was like five games in one, and when the player completed a level, they would move onto a level in the next game.  :The fifth level was a battle with the Flag Ship. It has all the hallmarks of a boss: It's much bigger than the player's ship, much better armed, has its own forcefield, and is only minorly damaged by the player's weapon. The only way to destroy it is to hit it in its weak spot - a reactor situated deep within the ship.  :Now I think about it, I don't know why I didn't mention this before. The thing is, I always thought of the Flag Ship as a 'level' rather than a boss. There wasn't really any concept of a boss at that point in history. Still, it's a start.  ",0

"`  == IPA - what ==  I read the main page of the article on IPA. On the plus side it is clear. On the minus side, it makes no attempt to explain what the IPA is.  (context, scope, purpose, etc.) Nice chart.  Lots of data (for people who probably have no need of it) but virtually no general information. My questions (which weren't answered - keep in mind I'm a totally lay person): An alphabet is used to 1.  Communicate between a writer and a reader (of the same language), 2.  Describe that communication (unambigously?)  Right?  Certain things are implied by its name, but clearly one should define what the subject of the alphabet is (are).  I have no idea if it covers all indoeuropean languages not to mention Mandarin Chinese (etc.)? Does it (attempt) to cover all spoken languages? Written?  What about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff).  Sign-language?  We now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but I digress.  From a simplistic point of view language can be thought of as being three distinct (context sensitive) types of communication: written/read, spoken/heard and performed/viewed.  I suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks.  SO what does the IPA do?  It just occured to me that maybe the IPA is (now-a-days) only used by euro-centric hobbyists and that would explain why there was no attention given to giving a serious explanation of what it is: ``if you have to ask...{then you don't need to know}```",0

"`  I disagree with the hard-and-fast division into ``English`` and ``non-English`` in the Billion and Trillion (which is too definite IMO) articles, (but agree the accepted Wikipedia value should be the US one). Here is why.  My Collins English-German dictionary, third edition, purchased in England 1997, has this entry:  Trillion n (Brit) Trillion f; (US) Billion f.  Now the Trillion referred to is the German for 1 followed by 18 zeroes, and Billion is the German word for 1 followed by 12 zeroes. My few German acquaintances tell me they know this difference between the British and American (US) usage of ``Trillion``. Similarly for Billion. Also I did once hear an English-speaking person use ``milliard``, I had to ask them what it was! They (a well educated but non-British person) thought it was a common English word.  My Cassell's English-Italian dictionary, admittedly an old 1985 edition, makes the same distinction in this way:  Billion Bilione (English, 1,000,000,000,000; Amer. 1,000,000,000)  Similar distinction for Trillion. Neither divides the usage into ``English`` and ``non-English``, speaking or otherwise.  Admittedly current usage in the United Kingdom is either confusion or has adopted the American (US) usage. This has certainly been the case  in the financial industry. I was taught the 'old' British usage of both terms in a school run by Americans in a British colony (helps to pass the British exams).  The www.unc.edu link in Talk:Trillion above explains this, so I feel the articles should reflect this admittedly ambiguous difference. I tend to clarify when speaking English to well-educated non-British Europeans (who are aware of the problem with Billion and Trillion), as to exactly which I am using (``American`` or ``British``) to make it clear.  Having said all that I'm not sure what's best: American and non-American; English and non-English; British and American (how the dictionaries usually give it); standard usage and non-standard? - |  11:06, 2004 Jul 21 (UTC)`",0

"  While you are correct that 'toughened glass' could be considered a misnomer (toughness has a specific meaning with regard to the strength of materials), tempering glass is not.  In fact there are two ways to temper glass to increase its strength: thermal and chemical.  Regarding thermal tempering, you are incorrect that the surface of a glass is in tension even at room temperature.  On initial cooling you are correct that the surface is in tension and the interior is in compression. However, below the glass transition temperature the stresses reverse and the surface is in compression and the interior is in tension increasing the strength of the glass.  Prince Rupert's drops are a laboratory curiousity demonstrating this phenomena.  If a drop of molten glass is cast into a container of water, it solidifies into a shape roughly resembling a tadpole.  You can bang on the big end with a hammer and the glass drop will not break.  However if you nip the tail, the drop disintegrates into dust usually with a pop.  Thermal tempering is usually applied to windshields.  Chemical tempering is usually accomplished by ion exchanging a smaller atom for a larger atom at the surface again putting the surface in compression. Although glazing and surface crystallization can also be used.  For example, soda-lime-silica glass can be placed into molten potassium nitrate and exchange potassium for sodium in the surface increasing the strength of the glass.  Thermal tempering can increase the strength of glass from 70 to 200 MPa while chemical tempering can increase it 500 to 700 MPa.  Chemical tempering is commonly used to increase the strength of beverage containers. ",0

"`     Something I wanted to clarify about my last edit:  I simply had a problem with the original post since it wasn't accurate. Gas chambers were specifically built for exterminating the groups mentioned in my edit. Jehova's witnesses and homosexuals were put into concentration camps, and surely mistreated beyond any measure conceivable to us. The fact remains though, that they presented a normal, and small portion, of those prisoner populations, and were not treated different than the rest of the prisoners. Jews, Sinti and Roma were people the Nazis specifically targetted for extermination as a people. Later on there wasn't even imprisonment for these people, they were simply transported to the death camps.  A Jehova's witness could have saved its life by denouncing its community's faith and agreeing to be drafted to the Wehrmacht, a choice Jews didn't have. But this isn't my point and I'm not suggesting they should have done that.  But the fact I want simply to put out by my edit, is:  I've read about the Holocaust and the Euthanasia operation, I've read about the concentration and death camps, and the SS, Gestapo and SD ``security`` apparatus, but I didn't read about Homosexuals or Jehova's witnesses being specifically targetted for extermination by gas as distinct groups, maybe still as a part of the prisoner population, but not specifically.

Hagelin was supported by large factions within the Reform Party, most prominently that Mangia fellow and Lenora Fulani, because of their (in my opinion, unwarranted, but that is irrelevant) desperation to avoid Pat Buchanan's nomination.  When I voted in Illinois, John Hagelin was listed on the ballot as Reform, whereas Buchanan was listed as Independent, because the state party refused to go along with (the larger of the two factions of) the national party and supported Hagelin.  The Hagelin faction made Mangia party chair, which can hardly be seen as an outside takeover, because he was already an officer of the party. -  ",0

"  Ardent nationalism basically sums up every nation I can think of on the face of the planet at present.  It makes sense that a nation would extol the virtues of itself, right?  The PRC does not have a cult of personality, does not glorify male youth as fighters, does not glorify female youth as future incubators.  Mysticism is missing from official Chinese pronouncements too.  Also missing is the stated goal of said society.  Left Totalitarian regimes like China see a future where a hierarchy of work-production, and distribution can be overcome once production is more automated with robotics and technology and economic scarcity can be overcome.  Allowing private property is a means towards an end in the case of China (market socialism).  Right Totalitarian regimes see hierarchy as the natural and permanent order of things, and the existence of private property is not a mean to an end, but the end to be preserved within itself.  A broad definition of fascism which would more correctly have to be termed corporatism if we say that mysticism, gender roles, and ideological heritage/stated aims aren't necessary conditions, then that would also allow us to place countries like the U.S since the 1930's, social-democratic Germany, and Keynesian Japan in that category. The main difference between fascism and capitalist-democratic or more benign corporatist states is the right for trade unions and combinations to engage in collective bargaining and even work stopages (strikes) against the immediate consent of the state or business.   Unions have this right in China today, to a limited extent, as in the U.S to a limited extent.  On an economic basis, Germany may be considered more corporatist or economically interventionist than the U.S, but politically the citizens have more rights to protest and engage in collective bargaining or form new unions. Unless I can be swayed from this line of thought, and I am open to it, I will mercilessly edit out grouping the PRC as fascist.    ",0

"`  Ok, I retract my claim about British men's feet above!  English Customary Weights and Measures by Russ Rowlett describes a plausible origin whereby the natural foot (of around 9-10 inches) was initially used and 'evolved' to around 12 inches due to the length of 12 inches being a convenient multiple and subdivision of other lengths used at the time.  Apparantly, before the foot was standardised people used three different lengths: * a foot of 13 inches made from two shaftments of 6.5 inches each, * a foot equal to 12 inches, * a ``natural foot``, Latin: pes naturalis, of about 9.8 inches   has these tidbits about the measure: * the traditional Danish foot, equal to about 12.365 inches or 31.41 centimeters. * early civilizations of the Middle East had a longer foot, roughly 30 centimeters  * a Greek foot is at about 30.8 centimeters (12.1 inches) * a Roman foot at 29.6 centimeters (11.7 inches) * Swedish fot aka the Stockholm foot, equal to 11.689 inches or 29.69 centimeters * German fuss came in several versions: ** Viennese fuss was 12.444 inches (31.608 cm), ** Rheinfuss (Rhine foot) was 12.357 inches (31.387 cm) ** Bavarian fu?? was 29 cm (11.41 inches) * French pied had several lengths, the best known being the royal foot (pied de roi) of 32.48 cm * Italian pie varied, 29.8 cm was one common length, but Venice used 34.8 cm and Bologna 38 cm * Spanish pie was the traditional foot of Spain and: ** in Spain was about 27.86 cm (10.97 in) ** in Argentine was 28.89 cm (11.37 in) ** in Texas was 11 1/9 inches or 28.22 cm  Finally, in 1869 Benjamin Gould measured the feet of the Chinese Terracotta Army, and found the average foot length was 25.6 cm without shoes (10.07 inches) and 27.7 cm with shoes (10.9 inches) - |  22:42, 2004 Sep 27 (UTC)`",0

"  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a dictionary, but that's besides the point.  I agree: the element phosphorus is bound to be looked up more often than Phosphorus meaning Venus and so that article should take priority (in terms of where the user is taken when they search). However, Wikipedia is not designed to be used purely by Wikipedia editors or those clued up with its conventions (nor those willing to take the time to discover them), but by anybody who wants quick and helpful access to a topic. Is such a person likely to expect to find a footnote at the bottom of the element article - I certainly don't think so. I would have thought such a person would give up at that point and look elsewhere. I don't think such a person would expect the topic they're searching for to be a footnote to something entirely different. However, if the 'dab' (is that an official term?) is at the top of this article, this certainly isn't a problem.

His creed can certainly be said to be destruction of the current culture and certainly retrograde in many respects, seeking to return to a simpler subsistence level of existence (i.e. hunter/gatherer) but he definitely has an established ethos and world-view.

And given that the book is the original story, I believe that ``Joe`` should be used more often in the article than ``Jack`` (though ``the narrator`` fits the character's ``name`` more accurately). The article seems to lean too much towards being about the movie, which makes it seem as if it was the original source material instead of the book.

That dialect is certainly Macedonian in the geographical sense of the word. However, if we take modern Bulgarian and Macedonian as a starting-point, the dialect has many more traits of Bulgarian than of Macedonian.  You seem also to forget that it is politics that defines what is a language and what is a dialect and which dialects belong to a certain language, not vice versa. As regards the Slavic dialects of Macedonia, we have an almost universal acceptance of them as Bulgarian until 1918, then they become viewed as Serbian by most scholars, and we have actually started regarding the name ``Macedonian`` as a linguistic and not only geographical term since 1945.

"  == Parentacide ==  Parentacide is the term used to describe a child killing one or both parents. Although the subject is as abhorrent as suicide or infantecide, it is a part of our life that cannot be dismissed.  Parentacide dates back to Greek mythology, where Oedipus killed his father Laius and married his mother Jocasta. Frued coined the term Oedipus complex to describe a state of psychosexual development and awareness first occuring at the age of 3 1/2 years.  In 1989 Lyle and Erik Menendez commited parentacide when they murdered both of their parents in cold blood. Although the murders were at least partially motivated by money, the brothers alleged their father had abused them, which was their justification for the killing.  Jeremy Bamber committed parentacide by proxy and was convicted in 1986 of killing his adoptive parents, sister, and her two six year old sons. Although money was thought to be the motive for this killing spree, the fact that he was adopted indicates that the reasons behind the murders were less clear cut. Being adopted, Bamber very likely suffered from adopted child syndrome, which is a psychological maladjustment to the knowledge that his real parents had given him up for adoption.",0

I have done research on Minnan hua and they don't seem to always map to Cantonese in a few tones, perhaps they are confused by the different tones.  In some ways, I think Vietnamese is even closer to Cantonese than Minnan in terms of tones.  It almost maps to each one exactly.  The 2nd tone in Cantonese usually has the ? accent in Vietnamese and the 5th tone always have the ~ tone on top of the vowel.  Also, Vietnamese preserved some of the NG initials that seem to be dropped from Cantonese, eg.  ren2 (mandarin) ->  jan4(cantonese), but it has the ng inital in Hakka, Toisanese, and Vietnamese.  Cantonese doesn't distinguish between teacher/lion and poem. hakka/viet su  (sai in minnan i think) teacher/lion and   si  poem  But there's closer tongue curling relationship between Vietnamese and Mandarin.  (Possible tongue curling in older Chinese?  or Manchu influence?) shi  goes to th, su and all si go to t or s  zh goes to  chi, tr z  goes to t or ty  chi goes to xi, tr, si   (no real pattern) c   usually t  but some exceptions to tu or thu  Also, it seems that most (if not all) 2nd tone x, zhi, z initials in Mandarin has a hard ending (-k -p -t) in Cantonese.

Recently, the Prime Minister responded to a question on the environment with a stance very close to what the President Bush's was. This ``special relationship`` between George W. Bush and Tony Blair has drawn a mixed bag of reactions in the UK, but it continues to be strong. In November 2004, the Prime Minister travelled to Washington in hopes of using the close friendship to influence the President's stances on a European summit, environment/climate control, and an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.  :The first sentence is acceptable and is in the article. The second is where the problems start. ``The two's coordination is uncanny`` is the sort of statement one would make about two lovers, and will carry this meaning to readers. As for ``rarely ever voicing direct disagreements``, you will find this in most public utterances in diplomacy, regardless of any actual disagreements. For example read the press conference with Blair and Chirac earlier this month. The issue of dissent within the Labour Party over Blair has already been covered in the article and needs no repeating here.  :The UK government's support for the Gaza withdrawal plan is hardly ``a radical departure`` and, even if it was such a statement would be POV. See 'The Chariot of Israel' by Harold Wilson for the full story of British support for Israel over the years to 1981. Also, the Israeli Labour Party has supported it, and that carries weight in its British sister party. Then the use of the term 'acquiesced' which is only used in a subservient relationship and is therefore pejorative, as is the insertion of 'prestigious' before the regiment: this reads as if it magnifies any offence because the regiment involved was more distinguished than others.   :The remark about the environment lacks any detail but is irrelevant: the UK government policy hasn't changed and is quite distinct from the US, so anything which Blair might have said at a press conference is neither here nor there. Finally we come to a report of Blair's visit to the US which states that it was about the environment (it wasn't - see press conference) and is imprecise. This issue, and the rest of this edit, is better covered in the article as it was, and I have therefore reverted it.  `",0

"`  ==Video Poker==  Video Poker machine payout tables only represent a theoretical payout percentage. The vast majority of gamers cannot achieve that payout percentage because they do not play correctly.  It is essential to draw correctly depending on the content of each dealt hand, and there are strategy tables devised by computer which determine how to do so, depending on the payout table. (Hence you need different strategy tables for different payout tables!)  My ambition is to add such strategy tables to the Video Poker article, but I can't just copy-and-paste such strategies from an existing book due to copyright. To get around that problem, I have an off-the-shelf analytical program that allows the creation of strategy tables based on a weighting of difficulty vs. accuracy. These tables are slightly different than the published ones, but still accomplish the desired positive payoff.  If you're interested in getting a good feel for this, there is a training program called ``WinPoker`` available from Zamzow Software, (in the U.S.), that allows you to practice, as well as automatically run through a great number of hands using a given payout table and strategy.

In April of 2003, NOCIRC signed a contract with La Leche League International as an exhibitor and paid for exhibit space for their international conference held in July 2003.  Shortly before the event, the board of directors vetoed our admission as exhibitors.  Word of our attendance had spread to a minority of Jewish women in the organization who objected to our very presence.   NOCIRC has exhibited successfully at literally hundreds of conferences locally, regionally, and nationally.  We are asked back year after year.  Without religious prejudice, we provide information about the traumatic effects of circumcision.  We hand out our information pamphlets in a non-confrontational manner to those who approach our table because they are interested in learning about the issue.  Each year, we have a well-received exhibit booth for physicians attending the American Academy of Pediatrics national conference.   NOCIRC already counts among its supporters hundreds of LLL members and former members.  The silent majority of leaders within League are already on our side.    Attendees who were interested would have  appreciated our information; those who were not interested would have just walked on by.   The vast majority of boys who are circumcised in the United States are not sons of Jewish or Muslim parents.  Preventing these non-religious circumcisions has always been the primary focus for NOCIRC.  This painful surgery, the most common procedure that baby boys are forced to experience, puts breastfeeding success at risk.  Good chest-to-chest positioning requires mom to press her sonÉ??s wounded penis up against her body, and the pain makes him unable or unwilling to nurse.   La Leche League reported problems with breastfeeding by circumcised infants in their 1981 edition of The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.  In 1996, LLL ratified the Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative, along with 25 other organizations.  The organization accepted ten basic principles for mother-friendly care,  including the requirement that service providers must É??discourage non-religious circumcision of the newborn.É?ù (on-line at ).   The breastfeeding relationship does not begin in a vacuum.  In 2002, NOCIRC issued its position statement, É??The Effects of Circumcision on Breastfeeding,É?ù available at .  Researchers have found that some male babies are unable to suckle the motherÉ??s breast after circumcision.  The circumcised infant is in pain and is in an exhausted, weakened, and debilitated condition.  The circumcision procedure frequently causes the newborn to withdraw from his environment, interfering with his process of bonding and breastfeeding.   La Leche League claims it is a non-sectarian organization.  However, when it comes to circumcision, it is a religious organization.  A few powerful members are keeping clinical data regarding breastfeeding obstacles out of the hands of all members in order to further their personal religious viewpoint.  For six years now they have systematically excluded NOCIRC from simply having a table at their area and national conferences.   The Board of Directors has placed a higher priority on protecting religious circumcision than on breastfeeding success for the 94% of non-Jewish, non-Muslim  moms.  Jewish boys have seven days to establish breastfeeding before undergoing surgery; non-Jewish boys do not because they are circumcised at birth, and thus they are at a greater risk.   The BoardÉ??s action is hypocritical in light of LLLÉ??s own struggle with those who block the promotion of breastfeeding benefits for fear of upsetting parents.  LLL has itself been accused of producing guilt when they describe the advantages of breastfeeding in much the same way that NOCIRC is now being accused by LLL.   LLL has an obligation to its members to make available information on how circumcision affects breastfeeding.  New and expectant moms need this information ASAP in order to nurture a successful breastfeeding relationship with their sons.  NOCIRC can help to insure that this happens.  T",0

"`  == WikiProject Wiki Syntax ==  Good morning.  Thank you for helping to clean up the Wikisyntax.  I was not aware of that effort until I saw some of your edits.  I do, however, have to disagree with some of the minor changes you've been making in a couple of paragraphs where the author/editor has chosen to itemize his/her arguments.

"`  ?? I got in touch with the owner of the website mentioned above, and he has offered to e-mail me a scanned copy of the map in the book illustration, which shows an intermediate band where the white band occurs near the northern tip of Africa.  I had a closer look at the maps I found in the library, and none of them improves on what was in that website. The one major difference that a revised map probably ought to take account of is the division of Australia into two regions. I'll make overlays to check, but it looks like the only other changes involve reducing 8 zones to 5. If you check out the Cavelli-Sforza map (which I now think is a photo reproduction of the original map) you can easily understand why authors would decide to simplify the number of zones  Cavelli-Sforza's map is o.k. for the lighter half of the shades of skin color, but the darker shades are practically indistinguishable.  Sometimes, if you know where to look, you will see what looks like a little halftoning rather than straight black ink. But for practical purposes the map is pretty useless outside of the values that are shown in the Americas.   ?? In a way it was a good thing that the original map was so washed out. If I hadn't really looked carefully at it I'm pretty sure I'd have missed the white band. The uncorrected map has propagated so many places on the WWW that it's hard to believe the original maker of the digitized image has any objection to others using it.    ==Cleanup== We need to clean up the article. The sections should only treat what it says they do in the section title. For example, there shouldn't be a paragraph `` :``In everyday speech, race is often used to describe populations that are better defined as ethnic groups...`` at the end of ``History of the term``. Nor should the ``Anthropology and genetics`` section, being placed after the history section, i.e. we are through with the historical aspect now, begin with  :``In the 19th century many natural scientists made three claims about race: ...`` (i.e. this bit still belongs in the 'history' section). Also the case studies (USA, Brazil) should either be exported to special articles, or at least be placed after the more general phylogenetic subsection. Somebody should read the entire article and weed out repetitions, too.    == Von Luschan scale ==  ?? The von Luschan scale was a manufactured set of standard tiles that were colored so that a researcher could in relatively rapid order sort through his/her tiles and find the one that came closest to matching a given subject's skin color. Essentially the same method is still used today, at least in this increasingly anti-scientific nation, by dentists who want to match ceramic material used for making fillings with the color of their patient's tooth. They have a little cabinet full of ceramic ``teeth`` on little spindles. Each specimen has a different combination of hue and brightness from the others. Although one could easily create an electronic device to measure these factors to tighter tolerances, the low-tech device seems to meet professional standards. Similarly, given the fact that a subject's skin color could vary considerably due to contingent factors such as season and weather patterns, the von Luchan tiles probably provide all the accuracy that is useful. `",0

Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people.

So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji.

I also provided examples of critics who were murdered by MUHAMMAD himself. Al-Azhar is not a higher authority than Muhammad.  ::No, you have only provided two stories in Ibn Ishaq about Muhammad that are rejected by Muslims, such as rejected here.

I refuted that by giving examples that contradict that. You then claimed that every critic received a death sentence. You were refuted again. You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals. That's like posting (a much longer list) of Muslims/Sikhs who received death threats or were killed after 9/11, and claiming that American law allows Muslims to be killed. You were refuted again.  You need to provide names of prominent well known Muslim scholars (not anti-Islam sites or isolated radicals) for each of these cases and prove that they issued the death sentence.

Although Israelis viewed the visit in an internal political context, Palestinians saw it as highly provocative to them. On the following day, in the same place, a large number of unarmed Palestinian demonstrators and a large Israeli police contingent confronted each other. According to the U.S. Department of State, ``Palestinians held large demonstrations and threw stones at police in the vicinity of the Western Wall. Police used rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition to disperse the demonstrators, killing 4 persons and injuring about 200.``[4] According to the GOI, 14 Israeli policemen were injured.[5] Similar demonstrations took place over the following several days.[6] Thus began what has become known as the ``Al-Aqsa Intifada`` (Al-Aqsa being a mosque at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount). ``    ::Furthermore, in the article Terrorism_against_Israel_in_2000#August, it says Biri died in August after being attacked by ``terrorists``.

The al-Aqsa intifada is an upsurge in the violence that started after Sharon's visit to the al-Aqsa site. That is the commonly understood definition of al-Aqsa intifada.

While speaking via a loudspeaker and wearing a red coat, in front of a physician's home which the Israelis intended to bulldoze, Corrie fell down. A bulldozer then ran over her twice.

Corrie was a senior at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington.``  *A week after she was killed: ``Rachel Corrie (1979 - March 16, 2003) was an American peace activist who was crushed to death while attempting to block an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bulldozer in a Gaza Strip refugee camp.  Corrie grew up in Olympia, Washington, and graduated from Capital High School. She had been a senior at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, where she studied the arts and international relations. She took a leave of absence to participate in resistance against the IDF as a member of the Palestinian-led International Solidarity Movement (ISM). In her home town, she was known in the local peace movement and an active member of the Olympia Movement for Justice and Peace.  Friends describe Corrie as athletically slender with blond hair and thoughtful, intelligent eyes. She played soccer, gardened and loved the poems of Pablo Neruda. She was the daughter of Craig Corrie, an insurance executive, and Cindy Corrie, a school volunteer and flutist.``  *April 2003: ``Rachel Corrie (1979 - March 16, 2003) was an American peace activist who was crushed to death during the Al-Aqsa Intifada, while attempting to block an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bulldozer in a Gaza Strip refugee camp.  *From December, 2003: ``Rachel Corrie (April 10, 1979 - March 16, 2003) was an American activist who was crushed to death when protesting Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip.

"`It's worth noting somewhere that the term ``sustainable`` or ``sustainability`` is heavily deprecated among Greens and especially Gaians for implying some kind of steady-state output.  In other words, ecological yields vary, and can be maximized but will still vary considerably with weather patterns, insect migration paths, and etc... they can't be made as uniform as outputs of a factory - which almost seems to be the goal of ``sustainability``.  Also, to say something is ``sustainable`` or ``not`` implies that there is some actual test for it.  Which there isn't.  It's all a matter of scenarios and guesses.  The ``Limits to Growth`` type of numerical modelling, largely discredited now, was the actual origin of the ``sustainable`` paradigm.

"` What I find, reading these paragraphs, is a decidedly pro-Zayed bias. To assume that anyone who criticizes him in that article must have never went near the Middle East, or the UAE, is preposterous. My own contributions, as well as others, are based on travel and life in the UAE, as well as trustworthy sources like the BBC and Reuters, among others. Also, that he funded all those wonderful projects around the world is not in dispute. To say that it was from his own pocket, however, is ludicrous. As with all the rich Gulf leaders, their personal wealth CAME from the nation's oil wealth. Their checkbooks and the State Treasury were often indistinguishable. Nevertheless, Zayed could have easily chosen to horde the UAE's wealth only for Emiratis, but he didn't, and that is evident. As far as the propaganda pictures and TV footage Falcon44 refers to, I have seen it with my own eyes. It does not negate what he did, but it's important to edify readers that Media in the UAE is strictly controlled, and cult-worship of the ruling families was institutionalized. Again, this does not mean that Zayed was not genuinely liked and admired, but it is important to state all the facts. The simple fact is that there was not one jot of criticism allowed on the airwaves or in print. This is no great slur on Zayed or the UAE. The only 3 relatively lively and free presses in the Arab world are Lebanon, Egypt, and pre-war Kuwait. Qatar is just now experimenting with free media. Regardless, what is more evidence of a pro-Zayed bias then the systematic removal of every scrap of criticism from the article? Why do certain individuals not want the world to know that one of his weddings is recorded in the Guinness Book of Records as the most expensive ever? Why are they afraid to let people know that Zayed's ``election`` to the Presidency was by a mere group of 6 sheiks and not by a free and popular vote? All these facts were shamelessly deleted several times from the article. THAT is what I call bias. Also, you quoted one of his advisors. It is not very shocking that such a person would be overflowing with praise about his employer and benefactor. I do not consider that an objective source. That doesn't mean it cannot be mentioned. As long as it is made clear who said it, the readers can draw their own conclusions about the possible bias of the quotation.  Perhaps you should include that quotation in the article, Falcon. Also, regarding the Zayed Center, that was not my contribution, but I find it very interesting. What you mentioned about it in this talk section is very important. I look forward to you expanding on how he founded the center, and why he became disenchanted with it and withdrew his support.

"`  :: According to ``The Uralic Languages`` (edited by Daniel Abandolo), palatalization is a feature of every language discussed in the book. They include Erzya, Meadow Mari, Hill Mari, Komi, Udmurt, Khanty, Mansi, Hungarian, Nenets, Selkup, Nganasan, Kamassian, Livonian, Estonian, Finnish (eastern dialects), Votic, Veps, and Northern Sami.

"`   == Synagogue ==  Hi there! One or two comments and, please, do not be offended:   Synagogue comes from the greek words ?ü???´ 'syn' = con (as in 'con-servative' for example) and ?Ò???????? 'agogi' = discipline/manner/education, which itself comes from the verb ?™???Ê???´ 'agein' = lead (also look here: http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=synagogue)  The word 'agogi' from the ancient times (and even today!) has an absolutely positive meaning: for example, in modern Greece, people say ``He has agogi`` meaning ``He has manners``, ``He knows how to behave`` etc.  Therefore, I would ask you to accept my previous correction, which for some reason you thought it was offending or negative.

" -  The first paragraph of the 'notable characteristics' section states that aluminium is both soft and strong. This seems unlikely to be the case. In the case of pure aluminium the yield strength is in the region of 10 MPa which certainly isn't strong as far as construction materials are concerned (Al alloys may have yield strengths in the region of 200-500 MPa). As a result I have removed the word strong (alloying is mentioned later anyway).  Surely aluminium is not resistent to magnetism but is simply non-magnetic? I have altered the 'applications' section to reflect this (and hopefully I'm right).  The term 'weak' is ambiguous (strength, stiffness, hardness, toughness, fatigue resistance?). I replaced it with a link to tensile strength as this is probably the most familar mechanical property.",0

"  == Vic arious Liability ==  An employer is vicariously liable for negligent acts or omissions by his employee in the course of employment whether or not such act or omission was specifically authorised by the employer. To avoid vicarious liability, an employer must demonstrate either that the employee was not negligent in that the employee was reasonably careful or that the employee was acting in his own right rather than on the employer's business.  It can also be understood this way: When one person is liable for the negligent actions of another person, even though the first person was not directly responsible for the injury. For instance, a parent can be vicariously liable for the harmful acts of a child and an employer can be vicariously liable for the acts of a worker.  This I find very interesting, thinking of whether a demarcation exist. When can one say that the Employer is exonerated from the employee's acts, especially if the employee used the resources provided by the Employer (Tools, Vehicles, Landed Property etc)?  I require additional research to give more details.If however anybody has anything to add, please assist.",0

"  I wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims I am Ennis are false. If the 'Number is Ennis' dichotomy was removed the Talk Pages would be near empty! I wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.  But, that's rhetorical - as I said, there must be certain camaraderie among Wiki people and I doubt if youÉ??d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.  Now you have asked me a sensible question, so I'll answer.  For some time I watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the UK/claiming they were in the UK were summarily dismissed. Worse, posters were automatically accused of being Ennis.  One reason given was that the posts were anonymous.  So I thought, as I know more about Ennis than others from the UK posting here (IMO) I'd try to add to these pages. However, even with an identity, I got exactly the same treatment. In fact Cardinal Chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-Sollog website and is well known in Google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).  So it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'You're a sock puppet! YouÉ??re Ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.  I therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' I was not Ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others.   I tried to prove I was not in America (I thought these days all IPs were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) I quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.  This was dismissed.  Someone else even went to a pub in Lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.  That too was dismissed.  So it became obvious that no proof I (or anyone else) was not Ennis would ever be accepted.  Therefore the only other option if I felt I had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up BTW)  In vain did I quote Wiki Official Policy. Plainly it is not obeyed by Editors/Administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.  So what is left? I cannot invoke Wiki policy. I cannot 'prove' I am here, in England sitting quietly in front of a PC.  Two choices.  Stop posting completely  Try and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. The only challenge worth it would be one where I did not personally gain (Of course I would win because I am not Ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. Ashley) acted as 'witness'.  Hence the challenge.  I fear that will be deleted; I'll be castigated a usual and that's that. It really is just hopeless.  I have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted IÉ??ll know there simply is no hope and I'll delete all my posts if I can find them.  You see, unless people accept I am not Ennis everything I or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. I'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.  I have other interests - I posted on the Yoga page but it's quiet and I am interested in politics etc etc.  So we'll see what happens. Like I said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. Truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what I assume are adults.  So there you are. I have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. It will answer the question - at least for these Sollog pages - as to whether Wiki should be taken seriously or not.  Finally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article I am writing (I am a freelance writer and no, IÉ??m not going to prove it) before I send it off to newspapers.

"`  - Continued:  I checked the history of recent edits.  I find it hypocritical that the words ``sell`` and ``price`` have been changed to ``offer`` and ``donation``. What the * is that all about? Is it because THC Ministry has been registered as a religion that the action of trading funds for a product has ``miraculously`` transformed from simple business to ``donations`` and ``offerings``? That is marketing speech. That is in no way different from any businessman's simple strategy.  Since THC Ministry supposedly ``offers`` a product in exchange of a ``donation``, shouldn't that imply that they would also give away freely the product in some cases? Shouldn't that imply that there would be no set price, as a donation is usually considered an act of variable value? Because otherwise that is just PLAIN BUSINESS. Nothing saintly about it.  I would like to know - just to clear things out - where these ``donations`` go to and who they benefit. Are the funds used to address the issues of unethical drug wars? Are the funds used to fight what is wrong in society? Or are they merely collected to the personal accounts of the ``priesthood`` of THC Ministry? Who could answer me?

"`   ==Changes, subtle errors == Oleg, I am concerned about the edits that you are making.  My first impression is that it is much harder to understand than it used to be.  It used to be precise as to what it meant; much of that precision has been removed. The result is the sublte introduction of errors...   in part by removing that precision.  For example, the ring over tau_p is not isomorphic to the ring x^n^p which is what you seem to be implying; the degrees of polynomials are totatlly different: if P(tau) is a polynomial, then  n^(deg P(tau)) = deg P(x) one is kind-of-like the exp/ad of the other, sort-of.  And you cut out the paragraphs that made this distinction: tau a is not equal to a tau, but tau a is equal to a^p tau ...  The ring is never commutative when the field is not F_p ...   The field is called F_p not Z/pZ dammit. We already talked about this before. Nobody but you calls it that.  Stating that aP(x) is also additive is important, I don't see why you cut that out.   k{tau} is not k[x] e.g the next theorem to mention is that for any p(x) in k[x] there exists a g(tau) in k{tau} such that f(x) divides g(x).  These g(tau)'s are a left ideal in k{tau}  Using language like ``its quite easy to prove`` and ``it follows quickly`` and ``it can be shown that`` is, at best, filler, and, at worst, misleading as to the actual difficulty of the theorems you are alluding to.  Look, I don't see why you need to be monkeying with this article, why don't you write an article on Ore's invariants of the additive polynomials, or the moore determinant instead, hell, there is no entry for the vandermonde determinant even ...  or start the article on a carlitz module or drinfeld module instead, or fix the article on non-archimedean analysis which really needs a lot of work, cause its missing all that jazz ...    `",0

"`  *********************************  Josif Stalin IS one of the three worst criminals in the history of mankind, the other two being Hitler and Mao. Mao killed 38 million human beings, Stalin at least 25 million and Hitler at least 20 million. The figures are there on the CIA website. It is unacceptable to show Stalin and Mao as politicians on Wikipedia website when Hitler is depicted as a monster. All of them were equally monsters and the personal cult communism was no differenct from nazism in essence.  You need to be aware that most former eastern bloc countries banned the use and display of the five-pointed red star and the hammer and sickle symbols of communism alongside the swastika and some local fascist sysmbols, because they know from personal experience that the horrors of stalinism were no less than that of nazism. The hungarian law banning all these is the XLV. (45th) law of 1993, titled ``Az ??nk??nyuralmi jelk??pek haszn?≠lat?≠t tilt?? t??rv??ny`` and it has been upheld in constitutional court.  If you fail to mention the very criminality of Stalin and Mao in the very header of their wiki articles, then you are looking for an edit war, period. We, the people of ex-soviet bloc countries are personally insulted when anglo-saxons pet ``Uncle Joe`` as the kind old leader. Be glad he did not rule you (you may not have been born then with 10% probability because your father would get executed or die in the Gulags beforehand, no kidding). Acknowledge our sufferings by stating the truth: Stalin was one of the three worst criminals in the history of mankind, period.  Regards: Tamas Feher from Hungary (etomcat@freemail.hu)`",0
"`  You are Stalin apologets. Where is placed the mention of Katyin massacre, where several thousands of polish POVs were shot by NKVD upon Stalin's personal order? We hugarians are very close brothers of the polish people historically, so I find the lack of proper and emphasized mention of Katyin very painful. Stalin's crimes against Poland are amongst the most outrageous in written history. There is no excuse to the Molotov-Rippentropp pact. Make no mistake that was the Hitler-Stalin pact.  I really wish Stalin ruled you, not us. You are like Rumsfeld, who met Saddam during mid-1980s and praised him as a good ally in the anti-Khomeini Iran war. When will you realize that Putyin's current rule is an analog of Stalin's, characterized by extreme disregard for law, anti-semitism (most notably the early 50's doctor trials vs. 2004's Khodorkovski-Yukos) and imperialism (brutal military actions in the Caucasian Mountains both times and desire to the rule neighbours). Thus, by not mentioning Stalins criminality in unambigious terms, you hold the english-speaking world blind to Putyin's methods and you contribute to a ``new Uncle Joe`` sentiment, which will inevitable put the world and the poor Russian race in great danger. A repetition of history for those who refuse to learn about the past.  Stalin started his reign with a few million dead, by reversing Lenin's post-civil-war ``new economic policy`` of limited private agriculture thus leading to big famine.  The entire WWII in Europe would be over in 6-9 months had Stalin failed to entirely decapitate the soviet army's elite in 1937-39, this is clearly written in vol. 2. of soviet published seven-volume ``The history of the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945``. You are plain stupid to praise Stalin for a ``hard earned victory in WWII``.  So powerful was the fear of Stalin's evil power, that even us hungarians, who previously fought three revolutions and independence wars in the last 300 years, did not dare to raise again until autumn 1956 to free ourselves from stalinism. Anglo-saxons betrayed us big time then, shame on the Free World.  In churches renovated after WWII (big destruction in Hungary) the face of the Satan (as defeated by arch-angel Michael) is always of Josif Stalin's on wall paintings. People were shot for painting that.  Regards: Tamas Feher.`",0

"   == Ross Perot and the Reform Party ==  I edited to include Ross Perot because his candidacy everywhere was talked about as appealing to the 'radical middle' (in the press even). He said he was a social moderate and fiscal conservative, but his general tone was of centrismwhich is why for years after 'swing voters'/centrist voters/independents were called 'Perot voters'. On most issues he came to compromises between Democrats and Republicans with hard solutions. For instance he said both tax cuts and tax increases were needed. He also felt that partisanship and gridlock between the parties caused most problems, including incessant debates on social issues like abortion. But he promoted issues that appealed to the center (that weren't just plain 'centrist' but pro-active positions that at that time hadn't been talked about much before) like balanced budgets, campaign finance reform, referendums, term limits, etc.  The Reform Party was based on this platform and was radically centristmembers even called themselves 'centrist'. People in the party felt there were definite issues that needed to be solved, and the two major parties had to be challenged to solve them, with the creation of a new party. Today, many might say the party has a chink in this line of thought, because after Pat Buchanan and his supporters entered the party in the 2000 election, hard stances on immigration started to enter party platforms.  Which is somewhat right-but even still it doesn't compromise on the idea. I read Noam Chomsky once wrote that in America the groups on the fringes of politicslike Nader on the left, Buchanan on the right, and Perot in the center, agreed substantially on their significant issuesand he proposed that they joined together in a pretzel to form the 'radical middle'. A radical 'centrist' is an uneasy concept, since politics always changes and what will be moderate will change. The idea here though is that there is a growing set of issues that is not shared by left or right parties (fair trade, campaign finance reform, balanced budgets). That those who support these issues also carry different baggage of their own, tied to left-right positions, like Buchanan with abortion or immigration, should be expected.  If you're talking about John McCain, he plays to many of these positions (but is still free trade). But he's usually still what you might call a 'sensible' centrist and usually falls on the right, where he is. I was in the Reform Party (i think my analysis is accurate so don't bring up the bias), and many members hated McCain because he was a 'false reformer'-for instance his McCain-Feingold act made it even harder for third parties, while not doing anything substantial for reform. The sentiment was that he was just taking advantage of the issues for his public image. If you even listen to his speeches on reform he gives no substance just uses the phrase 'special interests' liberally.  From what I know about UK politics, Tony Blair looks more like Clintonesque centrism (which is purely political) than anything else.   ",0

There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.  Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content.

"`  : For the benefit of the many, let's elaborate on ``A clear misuse of Juran's assumption (...)``:  : In manufacturing, systems are designed so that everybody contributes a pre-defined amount of work, especially in synchronous settings such as assembly lines. Nobody could argue for a Pareto distribution there.  : In agriculture and mining, individual contributions are sometimes measurable (e.g. basketful of apples picked per person per shift). A for-profit organization seeks out ``good`` workers, so the bottom part of the distribution will not be represented at all. Family and community operations often find a way to gainfully employ persons with less strength (e.g. 11-year-old girls) or with disabilities (e.g. blind people), but their number is not large enough to warrant a Pareto distribution.  : Which brings us to the only economic system many readers have experience of: The services sector.

"`  == Some things to note about Stalin ==  1., Many and most photos of Stalin are either heavily doctored or even fake. He was known to aviod photographers because his face was ugly from heavy pitting and canker. He had a number of better-looking doubles (stand-ins) to serve in PR opportunities. He used to stand on high/remote pedestrals when must appear in public to avoid close scrunity.  2., It is a commonly held opinion in Eastern Europe (I think it is a fact) that Josif Dsugasvili was an ordinary highwayman by profession before he joined the revolutionaries. He used to rob trains with a grops of outlaws, forcing people to stand and deliver.  3., Isn't it strange the Stalin Wikipedia article does not include the word dictator / dictatorship (or anything that starts with dict*) at all according to IE's search? Political correctness should not run amok, especially considering this is english language Wikipedia and US people know very little about foreign relations and history by school education, so it is easy to indoctrinate them by ``kind ol' Uncle Joe`` babble. Or do you think only ancient roman leaders can be called a ``dictator`` per definitionem?

This figure agrees well with what is typically seen on reverse osmosis, ultrafiltered and deionized ultrapure water systems used for instance, in semiconductor manufacturing plants. A salt or acid contaminant level exceeding that of even 100 parts per trillion (ppt) in ultrapure water will begin to noticably raise its conductivity level by up to several hundred kilosiemens per meter.``  Now, I know wikipedia must conform to standards, a policy which I am an ardent advocate of, and the meter is the SI unit of length as is the kilohm. However, ultrapure water is never, ever referred to using these units. It is always referred to as being 18.2 megohm-cm and has in fact been so often used with these terms that it has bcome synonymous with them and is often simply called ``megohm water`` in the literature.

"`Certain none of the responsible people were interested to take credit for those insignificant bridges.  The term ``mukim`` was certain the Malay name for the area smaller than the district level. In Malaysia that term is still in used on the maps. For instance there is a place know as Senai in the State of Johore.On the Map it is listed as Mukim of Senai. The Roman numeric standard was an older form of numbering adopted for used by the the British from the Latin. For instance  I (one) to X (ten), V (five) and III(three). So when the figure of XVIII is exactly 18 by our new standard. Therefore the name Mukim XVIII of Ang Mo Kio signify the area located on the Map. Presently it not the site of the New Town of Ang Mo Kio but just next along side. It was the housing estate built by the United Overseas Land Limited known as ``Faber Gardens``. This was the kampong area where our old attap dwelling used to stand at No. 126 A Lorong Kukus.  In conclusion I suggest that the name of Mukim of Ang Mo kio is far older than the new Town of Ang Mo Kio. It is highly likely than the name was chosen by Town builders following that original name on the Map.    `",0

"  Andy, thank you very much! )  What are the locations of those lost buildings?  All in Aachen?  I was wondering if the Holy Roman Empire was supposed to be inclusive for the whole of Western Europe, such as unofficially having traditionally independent places as England and other Catholic lands as subdivisions during that time.  The reason being, that there was only one emperor during those times(in the West) and only after Protestantism did multiple emperors become a feature of Western Europe.  Was the King of England a Sovereign during the time predating the Anglican schism, or was he subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor?  I postulate this, due to the fact that the Cardinals and Archbishops were subordinate to the Pope and figured that there's some part of history not being told to enough children.  Wouldn't that be a reason to break with the Vatican back then?  Once Henry broke with the Church, he was able to incorporate Wales and the Royal House changed from province to surname.  I was thinking that the provincial royal house like Anjou, Blois or Normandy is a Continental style.  Once England broke away, they went to personal names like Tudor and Stuart...even though Henry was technically of the House of Richmond.  Once England had become the center of another empire, just of its own, they reverted to usage of provincial houses.  So, what do you think...Am I right?",0

"`   == Ward Churchill is Not An Indian == I am an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and I used to work for the BIA. I added into the article the written opinions of people that have researched Churchill's Indian ancestry and 99% of these Indian folks point out that Churchill has not provided the basic information required to prove that he is an Indian. I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear Fred Bauder, it IS fair to ask if Churchill really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from Idaho was writing books about himself being a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because Churchill himself compares and uses Hitler and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all ``Eichmann's.`` Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in Indian Country know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As Suzan Harjo pointed out: Churchill is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, Harjo made the point that Churchill's comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in Kentucky and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came the United States from South Africa, do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in Belfast? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: Suzan Harjo (worked for Bill Clinton), Dennis Banks (Founder of the American Indian Movement), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of Colorado should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah `",0

"  == Some personal observations here: == Put a summary of it into the Roots of Christianity; perhaps a whole subsection thereof.  If the Zoroastrianism part is included, then so must the Egyptian especially since the Hebrews were long associated with Egypt back to the Hyksos invasion.  It would be POV to disclude this factor, considering the trail of monotheism left by Akhenaten and adopted by the Hebrews.  I myself don't know much about Zoroaster, but I certainly recognise much of the Egyptian issue and I'm more of a casual researcher.  It seems to me that Zoroastrian elements are tied to the Persian background, but it would be prejudiced to say that the Egyptians have no basis when they long dominated Palestine.  The Greek Pharaoh himself patroned the Septuagint in Alexandria.  I find the bigotry towards an Egyptian root of Christianity to be entirely unfounded when so much of Egyptian culture was adopted by all peoples in a certain radius outwards.  Perhaps this lies in traditional ideas about race; that the Hamites of Africa have not contributed anything and that the Persians supposedly were/are White or considered Japhethic as opposed to the Semites.  Seriously, this Noahidic classification thing is ridiculous because these Afro-Asiatic people are undoubtedly very much alike and most uninvolved observers would say they are less White than the Greeks and Romans.  I consider Persians to be Semites because they are Asian, in this context.  Give it as much credence as the Persian foundations and you will make this NPOV.  I seriously suggest expounding upon both roots of Christianity and also delineating the Greek root which provided Roman impetus for adoption and proliferation.  For instance, if the Greeks hadn't patroned that religious culture as their relation to Philistines, Rome would have dismissed it as everything else in their cultural relationship with Greece.  Rome even rebuilt Greek Philistia as Palestine and during the Catholic Crusades, it became the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  Christianity has so many dimensions, that it would be haughty to overlook its far ranging origins which even has pagan influences from Europe and Buddhist ties in Southwest Asia.    I myself used to be atheist or Odinist not wanting to deal with what I percieved to be other peoples' culture and now I look in wonder at the historical background of the Sea Peoples and the subsequent Graeco-Roman expansion in the Mediterranean Sea.  There are European roots throughout the region now considered Islamic or Arab, but if we don't provide the means for people to see it we will forget it as much as the terrible destruction of the Library of Alexandria.  Just think of the term Indo-European and you will understand Alexander the Great's empire.  See the connection between the European fylfot and Indian swastika or the Cross and the Ankh?  Please don't demolish this magnificent research, for it has been a great boon in my life to know these things.  I am only stating things as I commonly have studied and heard of them.  I do not propose to limit and debar other positions on this issue, therefore I am not endorsing POV.  The various sources I have seen via Google search appear legitimate and/or sometimes biased(as anything!), but it is not my position to judge the appropriateness of the topic.  We are not to cast a POV on the issue in favour or against, just to deliver as any messenger does.  The existing article on the History of Christianity provides the Persian background but does not give adequate coverage of the Egyptian or Hellenic origins, which are quite prominent.  After all, Christianity had most of its evolution in non-Persian areas of the Mediterranean Sea.  Tell me, how many Persian people are prominent in the Christian world throughout its history?  What fractionary comparison can you draw that factually examines the amount and shows a majority of Persian elements in Christianity, compared to the vast amount of Greek specialty(as written, verified and generally known amongst the entire Christian populace) and the nursery of Christianity itself in Egypt via the Old Testament(even Jesus's infancy was spent in Egypt, in safety from Herod!)?  Please, where is the background of Christianity in Persia besides 19th century racial studies?  Like I've said, the Noahide classification thing has been similarly discredited and its density in weight grew most during that era for Indo-Aryan racist theories.   ",0

But there's possibly an issue with one of the taggers currently working on the project I wanted to bring to your attention, since you're so involved with it.  The description page for an image I posted some time ago showed up in my watchlist today, so I checked it out.  Turns out that a previous vandal had removed my {{GFDL}} tag along with the source info.  That change went unnoticed by me, so it landed in the latest list of untagged images.  Today's change was  putting a {{PD}} tag on it.

I looked at this user's contributions, and [s]he is busy tagging away.  But it looks to me like that user is being way too free with {{pd}}. I know for a fact that [s]he tagged my image {{pd}} without cause (didn't even query my user talk page), and others look suspicious, too.  I also see [s]he has tagged images {{unknown}} that should have {{gfdl}} (:Image:Laferteairshow001.jpg),  {{unverified}} that should have {{coatofarms}} (:Image:Villegaignon-crest.gif), and other problems.  I left a note on the user's talk page about my map image in particular.  I don't know if you or someone else would want to review this user's tagging contributions and try to educate the user on how to do a better job.  I'd attempt this myself, but, as I said, I'm too busy to contemplate getting into a back-and-forth with someone or going through and retagging all the images [s]he has touched.

"`  == Pathetic Motorways, and the ``Walton Summit Motorway`` ==  I resent the implication, being the webmaster of the aforementioned site.  The site is not a ``Wacky Website``, but a factually accurate record, with comments tossed in.  You are allowed to educate without boring people, you know!  UncleG is proceeding from a false assumption:  that the classification of all motorways is listed on signposts.  There are many other examples of ``unsigned`` motorways where official DfT documentation exists, such as the tiny A635(M) in Manchester or the A14(M) in Cambridgeshire.  The Walton Summit Motorway is an extremely unusual case.  Whilst it is quite true that there are many short motorway spurs that are simply a part of the ``parent`` motorway, such as the M1 spur at Luton, the Walton Summit Motorway does not fall into this category.  As is clearly pointed out, the Walton Summit Motorway is neither part of the M61, nor part of the M65, but does have motorway classification because it inescapably leads to the roundabout that links the two.  There is no other stretch of motorway in the UK where a short ``spur`` motorway actually links two different motorways.  If it is part of the M65, as the ``start of restrictions`` sign at the bottom of the hill implies, then why does the directional flag sign state ``M61 (M65)``, meaning a part of the M61?  This is a common form of signage throughout the UK system, but is unusual to be found upon a motorway.    A similar item can be seen with reference to the example of the A635(M) above, the ``start of restrictions`` sign when heading westbound on the A635(M) clearly states ``A57(M)``, but the DfT documentation states otherwise. (it's the ``Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 3266 The City of Manchester (Mancunian Way A635(M) and A57(M) Mancunian Way Slip Roads) Special Road Scheme 1992 Confirmation Instrument 1995`` that you're looking for if you're really concerned about its accuracy.  A PDF copy is available on Pathetic Motorways, but a simple Google search will turn up the relevant central government pages if you doubt the source material).  The Walton Summit Motorway is a motorway without a number, hardly an unusual concept in road terms, where most roads either do not possess a classification number, or is of a ``C``, ``D`` or ``U`` classification, which do not appear on road signs.  It is, bowever, an unusual concept in motorway terms.`",0

"Ignoring the question of how long it will take to actually use it all up, I am prepared to concede the point that if the modern increase rate in CO2 can be extrapolated to burning all known reserves then that would put us at about 700 ppm or less (2.5 times preindustrial levels).  Now, there is a big if in there since we don't really know how existing carbon sinks like soils, forests, and the oceans will respond to increasing CO2.  Right now, these systems buffer the atmosphere so that the annual increase at Mauna Lao is actually significantly lower (by about 50%) than if you just calculate the increase expected from all the CO2 humans dump into the atmosphere.  Basically because CO2 has increased, these systems draw down more CO2 than they did in preindustrial times and hence partially offset our pollution.  Some scientists think this buffer will become ever more effective as CO2 rises, others think it will saturate and a substantially lower fraction of our waste will be absorbed.  Obviously, such uncertainties are important for figuring out max CO2. :::Taking for the moment a value of 700 ppm as a reasonable end point, that still seems potentially bad.  How bad probably depends on how sensitive things like thermohaline circulation are to multiple degree changes in temperature, and how big a feedback is associated with retreating sea ice and permafrost.  Not exactly a risk I am eager to take given existing climate uncertainties.  However, at face value it would seem to take some disasterous scenarios off the table.  For example, it is estimated that the wholesale deglaciation of Antarctica won't occur till 3-3.5 times preindustrial CO2 levels.  (This was presented at a conference of the American Geophysical Union, but I am having trouble finding a reference). :::I think your consideration of how high can CO2 levels really get is a valid one, and potentially very intersting.  However, given the uncertainties involved in such estimates, I would really like to see if we can find something published on the issue.  An academic paper would (hopefully) have spent more time thinking through these issues and work out what kind of a range of values is possible. :::   ",0

I suppose you have evidence for this?  The page you asked me to click says Ali knew persian and furthermore it quotes a Shia hadith which claims the following masterpiece of comedy: :Ali, then came up to the princess and asked: ``What is your name?`` The princess replied: ``The daughter of Jahan-shah``. Ali said: ``and so Shahr-banuyeh you will be called`` (``the bride of the land``).  Do you honestly believe that?!  That claim is embarrassingly stupid.

Oh, and for your good information, there is plenty of solid historical evidence that her name was Shahrbanoo, and the Arabs didn't gave her that name.  Even if and Arab knew some Persian, what are the chances they knew the difference between the double meaning of ``land/country and city`` for ``shahr``?  At any rate, the Zoroastrians also call her Shahrbanoo, and if her name was given by Ali to her, the Zoros would have referred to her by her original name not by her allegedly Arab given name.

Anyhow, I will give you a bit of clue free of charge.  The reason there are some favourable Hadiths for Iranians is, surprise surprise, because out of the 6 main Hadith authors, 4 were Iranians, including the 3 most authoritative ones:  Bukhari, Termezi and Hajjaj.  Nasai was also Iranian.  The first 3 were Khurasani, and Nasai was from Pars.  The other 2 Hadith authors are not as major and their works are basically a copy-and-paste from the Hadith of the Iranian authors.  Hajjaj was from Neyshapour but claimed to be of Qushayri origin, so that he was better accepted as some ``real Arab`` from an authentic Arabic origin, but there is academic information that he was indeed of Khorasani origin, and his claim of ``al-Qushayri`` roots is unverifiable.  The most authoritative of the Hadiths is al-Bukhari (from the city of Bukhara).

Re my username, while I understand that many people harbour predjudice against trolls, my username expresses my belief that in building a neutral, accurate encyclopedia, creative and innovative approaches are helpful. I believe that trolling is an important part of any wiki, and without people who are willing to creatively challenge accepted assumptions and groupthink a community may stagnate or fail to maximise its opportunities. Many people who say they are against 'trolling' are actually, when you talk to them about it, against vandalism, personal attacks or timewasting, none of which I condone. I think that w e need to be more tollerant of different approaches as a community, and more willing to try to understand each other - in that way we can build the best encyclopedia possible.

"`   ==Constance Cumbey Update on March 5, 2005 at 10:44 p.m., E.S.T.==  Squeakbox's allegations about Nazism and editing a Rastafarian page (to the best of my recollection I have never been to such a page  my knowledge about Squeakbox's Rastafarian sympathies came from his own Wikipedia page)are nothing short of libelous and outrageous.  Obviously he has never read my work.  Most likely he is unfamiliar with the extremely readable and scholarly books of James Webb on occultism, including Nazi permutations of same.  Nazism was clearly based on occultism  evident in every respect from the Thule Society and Theosophical Society roots to the swastika itself.  Hitler did not take his notions from a vaccuum  his notions of ``cleansing actions``, ``master races`` and ``aryanism`` were standard fare in all occult reading  both of Rosicrucians and Theosophists.  As far as left hand swastikas and right hand swastikas are concerned, there are ample books (many of which are in my personal library) showing that it was used interchangeably both ways in both occult and Indian cultures.  The Jews were singled out for hatred in most such literature and still are in the books published by Lucis Trust / Lucis Publishing Company.  Just look at the indexes (and you can do free internet searches):  ``Judaism:  evils of``; ``Judaism, need for dissolution of``.  I have BATTLED Nazism and racism all of my life, starting at age 4 when I told an aunt, ``that man's not bad because he wants to move in your neighborhood.  You're bad because you want to move out just because he's moving in . . .``  Squeakbox owes me an apology.  He confesses he flunked logic.  He also confesses to a closed head injury with a machete type instrument.  For that, I will give him in good Christian style, a charitable interpretation and hope to think that these are his honest interpretations.  Read the New Age books CAREFULLY and not in an altered state  you will find that they are not all peace, light love.  And people who come against them are not ``Nazis``  the kernel of Nazism is the occultism which in its essence spells doom to all who are not blonde, blue-eyed pagans in its ultimate world view.  I have many a New Age book from the early 1980s in my vast personal collection which tells Orientals, Africans, etc., that they should be practicing celibacy as their races are destined to die out anyway.  As regards Solana, he is smart enough to see the Club of Rome agenda for what it clearly is  a global population reduction and occult indoctrination program.

The theory that the vaccines cause Autism isn't accepted by the scientific community. Some weaknesses of the theory (from Quackwatch.org): # The known number of ASD cases has been increasing since 1979, but there was no jump after the introduction of MMR vaccine in 1988. # Cases vaccinated before 18 months of age had similar ages at diagnosis as did cases who had been vaccinated after 18 months or not vaccinated, indicating that vaccination does not result in earlier expression of autistic characteristics. # At age two years, the MMR vaccination coverage among the ASD cases was nearly identical to coverage in children in the same birth cohorts in the whole region, providing evidence of an overall lack of association with vaccination. # The first diagnosis of autism or initial signs of behavioral regression were not more likely to occur within time periods following vaccination than during other time periods. # A weak statistical association existed between MMR vaccination and initial parental concern, but this appears to have been due to parents' difficulty in recalling precise age at onset and a preference for approximating the age as 18 months.  :What seminar did you visit?

"`   First of all, I was unaware of the fact that counties are not treated the same way in the East Coast as they are out here. I won't argue the actual figures anymore because your's are obviously correct, and I was mistaken. BUT there is a distinct difference between ``feeling`` like you are part of a city and actually BEING part of that city. I grew up in the San Fernando Valley and now live in the Los Angeles County half of Agoura Hills, I am, by most any definition, an ``Angelino``. But I'm taking classes right now at Moorpark Junior College, which takes it's main pull of students from Simi Valley/Moorpark/Camarillo. Many of those people seem quite content with the fact that they AREN'T part of Los Angeles and are quite happy to remind people as much. They consider it to be a better ``cleaner`` life where they are and wouldn't want to become part of the city of Los Angeles even if given the chance. Beyond that, they simply aren't residents of Los Angeles or the Greater L.A. area even if they proclaim to be, regardless of what any resident or tourist alike would prefer to believe or tell people. By that logic, San Diego residents may as well start calling themselves Los Angeles residents, since San Deigo doesn't take much longer to get to from my house (about 3 hours) than does LAX (which can take 1 and 1/2 to 2 hours to reach in rush hour traffic).`",0

"`The following lists the chain of events which led to the inclusion of entities which are not countries to the list. I suppose it takes some detective work to come up with this, although it isnt really that difficult. I leave it up to you guys to interpret the intentions behind this sequence of events:  ===The old version=== As seen in the version timestamped 07:25, 7 Jan 2005 in this page's edit history, the page listed only countries (as commonly accepted to refer to fully independent entities as recognised by the UN), with an opening line which reads:  ``This is a list of countries that only have a land border with one other country.``  ===Carbon copy created=== On 01:21, 4 Feb 2005, a similarly titled page called List of countries bordering only one country was created by a user named . In the first version of that page, the opening line reads:  ``This is a list of countries and dependent territories having land border with only one country. Notes: This list includes dependent territories and some disputed or occupied areas that are de facto independent.``  Interestingly, that first version includes Hong Kong and Macau as the only two non-independent entities, while Singapore was listed under a classification called ``Arguable``.  ===Merger?=== Within a few hours, the page has evolved to this version at 03:13, 4 Feb 2005. Notably, he copied the introductory text from the first article into his version of the article:  ``Nations that only share a land border with one other country often have concerns about domination by the other state if it is larger. These can be fears of an outright take-over as has happened historically to such states as East Timor, which was part of Indonesia until very recently, and Ireland, which was part of the United Kingdom until 1921. Today concerns are often about economic domination as with the Canada/United States relationship or the Denmark/Germany one. Because much trade goes over land these countries are often heavily reliant on their single neighbour.``  In addition, he added the ``merge`` request with the above page within the same edit.  Back in this page, he also added the ``merge`` request at 03:11, 4 Feb 2005  ===Merged=== By 18:57, 7 Feb 2005,  fulfilled the merger request. This effectively places 's introductory paragraph concerning non-independent entities, as well as his entries for these, into that list as can be seen in edit version 19:01, 7 Feb 2005, without  probably suspecting anything unusual.  ===Contestations=== Since this merger, debates over the inclusion of entities which are not countries ensued, unsurprisingly, as we can see above and in the history of edits. It is interesting that  made no mention about the merger process which sparked this discourse. In addition, as we can all see from the above discussions,  was quoted as saying:  ``They aren't sovereign states, but the same treatment should applies to all lists of countries with the same setting. The notice at the top of the page already tells this list includes not only sovereign states, without any confusions.``  It has to be noted, that again he did not mention who was the one who wrote that paragraph, and nor did he mention how it ends up being introduced to this page.  ===Deductions and comments?=== The chain of events as I noted ends here.
